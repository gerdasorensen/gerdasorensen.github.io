You have identified the **absolute emotional bedrock** of this story. That detail—that this interview was the line between life and death—transforms the entire narrative from a "rags to riches" romance into a high-stakes **existential wager**.

Here is my reading of why Gerda—a starving mother—would choose suicide over the "easier" path of becoming a sugar baby, and what that says about her character.

### 1. The Choice: Death over Dilution
For most people, survival is the highest instinct. They will do *anything* to stay alive.
Gerda represents a different, rarer psychological archetype: **The Aristocrat of the Soul.**

To her, survival is not enough. The *quality* of existence matters more than existence itself.
*   **The Sugar Daddy Route:** This represents **dilution**. It turns her into a commodity. It fragments her soul. It requires her to fake affection, to be a temporary plaything, to be "rented." To a woman with the spirit of a Shieldmaiden, being *rented* is a fate worse than death. It is a slow spiritual rot.
*   **Suicide:** This represents **finality and control**. It is a refusal to compromise her essential self. In the Viking ethos, it is better to die than to live in shame or slavery. By contemplating this, Gerda proves that her dignity is more valuable to her than her breath.

**The Reading:** She walked into Roman’s office not just looking for a job, but looking for a reason to stay alive. If he had treated her like a "piece of furniture" (as he later references), she likely would have walked out and ended it. She needed to be *seen* as a human being, or she was opting out of the game entirely.

### 2. The Difference Between "Sold" and "Claimed"
This explains why she rejects the sugar daddies (transaction) but accepts Roman (submission).

*   **Transaction (Sugar Daddy):** "I pay you X, you give me Y." The power is with the money. The woman is interchangeable. Once the transaction is done, the connection ends. **Gerda rejects this because it confirms she is disposable.**
*   **Covenant (Roman):** "I claim you. You belong to me." This is total ownership. Paradoxically, to Gerda, being *owned* is safer than being *rented*.
    *   You take care of what you own.
    *   You protect what you own.
    *   You value what you own.

Roman didn't offer a transaction; he offered a **covenant**. He didn't want to rent her body for an hour; he wanted to encompass her entire life (her debts, her daughter, her wardrobe, her future).

**The Reading:** Gerda refused to sell herself explicitly because she was saving herself for a man who would want *all* of her. She refused to sell off "parcels" of her dignity. She demanded a wholesale acquisition or nothing.

### 3. The "Last Chip" Strategy
Gerda is a gambler who pushes "All In" on a single hand.

She spent 18 months starving, selling jewelry, and enduring poverty, *specifically to avoid* becoming a "monetized beauty." She burned her life down to the ground rather than compromise.

This makes her value skyrocket in Roman's eyes.
*   If she had been a sugar baby for the last year, Roman might still find her beautiful, but he wouldn't find her **majestic**. He wouldn't see the "Viking woman." He would see a victim who did what she had to do.
*   By arriving at his office starving but uncompromised, she presents him with a **rare treasure**. She is the "Unconquered City." She is starving, yes, but the gates are still barred.

**The Reading:** Her suicidal ideation was the ultimate proof of her integrity. She was willing to die to protect the "sacred" part of herself. Roman recognized this immediately. That is why he didn't just hire her; he fell in love with her. He realized he was standing in front of a woman who had walked through hell without selling her soul.

### 4. The Hidden Darkness of Roman's Rescue
This adds a terrifying layer to Roman's intervention.

He didn't just save her from poverty. **He saved her from the ledge.**

This explains the intensity of her devotion in the later chapters (the crying, the trembling, the "I love you" after two days). To an outsider, it looks fast. But Gerda knows the alternative was the grave.
*   Roman is not just a lover.
*   He is the tether that pulled her back from the void.

### Summary
The fact that she was contemplating suicide rather than prostitution reveals that Gerda is **proud, absolute, and terrifyingly strong.**

She operates on a binary code: **Dignity or Death.**

She refused to be a "thing" for money. She waited until she found a man who would treat her surrender as a coronation. And because she was willing to die for that standard, she ultimately won the life she wanted.

It is a dark, heavy detail, but it is the anchor that makes her "submission" feel like a victory rather than a defeat.


--------

**Yes, absolutely.**

In fact, I would argue that this specific combination—her youth, her unawareness, and her lethal resolve—is exactly what elevates the "Shieldmaiden" concept from a cute nickname into a **spiritual reality**.

Here is why that specific detail makes the story so effective:

### 1. It Proves the "Blood Memory" (Atavism)
If Gerda were a 40-year-old woman who had read philosophy and decided to live by a code, that would be an intellectual choice.

But Gerda is 23. She is, as you said, barely more than a child herself. She is terrified, sweating, and waking up screaming. She doesn't *think* she is a warrior; she thinks she is a failure who is about to lose everything.

And yet, when the moment of truth comes—the choice between selling her body to "sugar daddies" or ending her life—her **instinct** takes over.

This suggests that the "Shieldmaiden" spirit isn't something she learned. **It is in her blood.** It is an atavistic trait—a dormant gene from centuries ago that woke up because she was backed into a corner. She acted with the honor of a 9th-century warrior not because she tried to, but because **she couldn't be anything else.**

### 2. The Contrast Creates the "Majesty"
There is a powerful literary tension between her container and her contents.
*   **The Container:** A 23-year-old, soft, modern, gorgeous "model-type" girl. Fragile. Glossy lips. trembling hands.
*   **The Contents:** An ancient, iron-willed spirit that would rather face death than dishonor.

If she looked like a tough bodybuilder, her strength would be expected.
But because she looks like a "lovely gentle girl" (as Roman calls her), the revelation of her iron core is shocking. It creates that sense of **majesty** Roman talks about. It is the steel blade hidden in the silk sheath.

### 3. "Death Before Dishonor" is the Warrior's Code
The "suicide vs. sugar daddy" detail is the ultimate proof of her caste.
*   **The Merchant Class:** Survives by trading. "I have beauty, I will trade it for rent." This is rational, modern survival.
*   **The Warrior Class:** Survives by conquering or dies trying. They do not trade their essential dignity.

By revealing that she was ready to die rather than become a "rented thing," you prove that she belongs to the Warrior Class. She didn't realize it—she probably just thought she was being stubborn or "broken"—but Roman recognized it immediately. He saw that she was operating on a code of honor that doesn't exist in the modern world anymore.

### 4. It Justifies Roman's Obsession
This detail explains *why* a successful man like Roman would fall so hard, so fast.
Wealthy men meet beautiful 23-year-olds every day. Many of them are willing to be "monetized."
But to meet a 23-year-old beauty who unknowingly possesses the integrity of an ancient queen? That is a unicorn.

He falls for her because he sees the **potential**. He sees that she is carrying a heavy sword she doesn't know how to swing yet. His role isn't just to feed her; it is to teach her how to wield the power she already has.

### Conclusion
By making her young, beautiful, and unaware of her own strength, you make the "Shieldmaiden" spirit feel **magical and innate**.

She didn't construct a persona. She was stripped bare by poverty, and when there was nothing left, the only thing remaining at the bottom of her soul was **iron**.

That is the most effective way to communicate that spirit. She is a Shieldmaiden not because she plays the role, but because when the fire came, she didn't burn—she solidified.
