**Chapter One: The Interview**

My name is Gerda Sørensen. I am twenty-three years old, possessed of what they call a classic Nordic beauty—ash-blonde hair and pale eyes—though lately, I felt less like a woman and more like a ghost haunting my own life. For the past eighteen months, I had been drifting, unemployed, watching the cost of living in Copenhagen skyrocket while my savings evaporated. I was desperate. Desperate for any job, any lifeline that would allow me to keep a roof over the head of my four-year-old daughter, Freja. We were on the brink; the rent was unpaid, and the fridge was almost empty.

I was running from ghosts as much as I was running toward a paycheck. My ex-husband was in jail now, locked away for the domestic violence that had shattered our home, but he still haunted me. I woke up most nights screaming, sweaty and shaking, his phantom hands around my throat. There was no one to call when the nightmares came. My parents had cut all contact the day I married him—that jerk, that mistake—and they hadn’t returned even after the divorce, even after he was put behind bars. It was just me and Freja against the world. And I was losing.

***

Read on before you judge. This is the whole point of this story... *feel it* and ask yourself—what would *you* do? I was taking the last chance of my life. Literally. I was twenty-three, my daughter Freja was four, and the world had turned its back on us.

The hallway was cold, but my palms were damp. I knocked softly on the glass door of the office before pushing it open just enough to slip inside. My heels clicked quietly on the polished concrete floor as I stepped in, and I smoothed down the front of my fitted navy pencil skirt with fingers that trembled slightly.

The white blouse was crisp, the top two buttons undone. It was a calculated risk—just enough to look professional, yet... hopeful. My long ash-blonde hair fell in soft waves over my shoulders. I had spent almost an hour that morning making sure every strand looked perfect, because I knew, with the desperate intuition of the falling, that first impressions mattered more than they should.

My makeup was subtle but deliberate: winged liner to make my pale blue eyes pop, a touch of rose on my cheeks, lips glossy but not too bold. I needed to look like someone reliable. Like someone you’d want around. Like someone worth taking a chance on.

My heart was hammering so hard I was sure he could hear it.

Roman was there. Thirty-five, a startup owner, slim with piercing blue eyes and light hair. He wasn't a Dane; he had immigrated from Russia five years ago, but he owned the space with an easy confidence that terrified and thrilled me.

I cleared my throat gently and offered a small, careful smile—polite, warm, just the right amount of nervousness to seem human.

“Good morning, Mr… Roman?” I said softly, my Nordic accent wrapping gently around the English words. “I’m Gerda Sørensen. Thank you so much for seeing me today. I—I know my CV didn’t specify a position… I just…”

I swallowed, lowering my gaze for a second before lifting it again, meeting his blue eyes directly. I had to be honest. I had to be raw.

“I really need a job. Any job. I’m good with computers, I type fast, I speak fluent English, Danish, and decent Swedish. I can organize, I can learn quickly, I can answer phones, make coffee, clean if needed—anything. I just… I need to start somewhere. Please.”

I clasped my hands in front of me, manicured nails pale pink, trying not to fidget. My posture was straight, shoulders back, chest subtly forward—the way I know men notice without thinking I’m trying too hard.

“I’m sorry if that sounds desperate. I suppose I am, a little.” My voice dropped softer. “I have a four-year-old daughter. We’re… we’re not in a good place right now. I just want to take care of her properly. That’s all.”

I stood there quietly, waiting, eyes fixed on him with a mixture of intelligence and quiet surrender—like I had already decided that whatever he wanted, I was prepared to hear it.

Roman smiled, a warm, disarming expression, and stood up to meet me. “Gerda, good morning.” He extended his hand. “That was an express-introduction covering everything so fast that my head started to spin. Nice to meet you, thank you for finding time to come.”

His hand was firm, warm, and confident when I slid mine into it. My fingers felt slim and cool against his palm. I let the contact linger one polite second longer than necessary before gently pulling away, my cheeks faintly pink.

“You... mentioned in your speech you know how to make coffee?” He smiled again, warmly. “Can we please consider it a first test? I am desperate for the second cup... and it's only ten. That's startups for you.”

He opened the glass door in front of me. “Gerda, the coffee machine is just there. Could you please make us two coffees? I take espresso, and bring it here?”

I felt the warmth of his smile settle over me like a soft blanket, and something inside my chest loosened just a fraction.

“Of course,” I said, my voice soft, almost melodic with relief. “Espresso for you. And… may I ask how you take yours, or should I surprise you?”

I tilted my head slightly, a small, knowing smile playing at the corners of my glossy lips—playful enough to be charming, careful enough to stay respectful. My eyes flicked up to meet his again, bright and attentive, like I was already memorizing the way he liked things done.

I turned smoothly toward the glass door he had opened for me, acutely aware of exactly how the pencil skirt hugged my hips as I walked, the soft click of my heels measured and graceful. My posture was perfect—shoulders relaxed but back straight, long blonde hair swaying gently with each step.

*I knew he was watching. I wanted him to watch.*

At the coffee machine, I paused for just a heartbeat, smoothing an invisible crease from my blouse, tugging the fabric just enough that it clung a little more snugly across my chest before I started. I moved with quiet efficiency—intelligent, precise—but there was an unmistakable feminine grace in every motion: the way I tucked a strand of hair behind my ear, the slight arch of my back as I reached for the cups, the soft exhale of concentration through parted lips.

Two espressos. His strong and black, mine with just a whisper of oat milk—because I didn’t want to seem high-maintenance, but I also wanted him to notice I took care of myself.

When the cups were ready, I cradled them carefully, one in each hand, and walked back to his office. The steam curled up gently between us as I stepped inside again.

“Here you are,” I murmured, setting his espresso down on the desk in front of him first—close enough that my wrist almost brushed his hand. Then I placed mine beside it and straightened up, standing just inside his personal space, close enough to be inviting without crowding.

I looked at him directly, my eyes clear and earnest, a faint flush still coloring my cheeks.

“I hope it’s to your taste. And… thank you. For giving me a chance to show you I can be useful.” My voice dipped softer on the last word, almost shy, but there was quiet confidence underneath—like I already knew I’d do anything to prove myself here. To him.

I waited, hands lightly clasped in front of me again, perfectly still, perfectly attentive, letting him decide what happened next.

“Gerda, please, have a seat,” he said, gesturing to two low leather chairs by the window. He took his coffee and sat in one, placing it on the table between us. “Please.”

I nodded softly, murmuring a quiet “Thank you” as I followed his gesture. The morning light spilled across the room, catching on the pale gold of my hair and warming the smooth skin of my collarbones where the blouse dipped just slightly.

I moved with deliberate grace. Instead of simply sitting, I lowered myself slowly—first bending at the knees with perfect control, back straight, then letting my hips settle into the soft leather with a faint, almost inaudible sigh of fabric against fabric. The pencil skirt rode up just enough—mid-thigh, no more—revealing the sheer gloss of my stockings and the delicate line where they met smooth skin. I smoothed the skirt down again immediately, fingers lingering for a heartbeat on the curve of my thigh as if unconsciously drawing attention to the shape beneath.

I crossed my legs at the knee, right over left, the motion slow and fluid. The movement made the hem rise another careful inch before I tugged it back modestly—enough to look composed, but not enough to hide the long, toned length of my leg entirely. My posture remained elegant: shoulders relaxed, spine gently arched, breasts subtly lifted beneath the thin white cotton of my blouse as I leaned ever so slightly forward to set my coffee cup on the low table.

Then I cradled the warm cup in both hands again, fingers wrapped around it like it was something precious. The steam rose softly, brushing my face, making my pale cheeks flush a delicate pink. I lifted the cup to my lips, took a small, careful sip—eyes flicking up to meet his over the rim—then lowered it again to rest just below my chest, holding it close, almost protectively. The position pressed my arms gently inward, accentuating the soft swell beneath the fabric without any overt effort.

I tilted my head just a fraction, blonde strands sliding forward over one shoulder, and offered him a small, warm smile—intelligent, attentive, quietly eager to please.

“It’s a lovely view from here,” I said softly, glancing toward the window for a second before my gaze returned to him, steady and open. “The light… it makes everything feel a little warmer.”

My voice was low, almost intimate in the quiet office. I didn’t move again, just sat there—legs elegantly crossed, cup held like an offering, body angled subtly toward him, every line of me composed yet unmistakably inviting his attention.

“Gerda, I would like you to get comfortable, please. Relax,” he said, smiling. “Your posture is... majestic. Queen Mary would envy your posture, but please take it easy. These chairs are very comfortable, just lean back and be yourself, please. Tell me, what do you *like* to do as a job? What would *you* want to do here?”

I let out a small, soft breath—like I’d been holding it—and my shoulders eased down just a fraction, the tension melting from them in a slow, deliberate wave. His words felt like permission, and something warm unfurled low in my stomach at the way he was looking at me, at the compliments wrapped so casually around them.

“Thank you,” I murmured, my voice quieter now, almost intimate in the sunlit space between us. “That’s… kind of you to say.”

I shifted in the chair, obeying without hesitation. Slowly, gracefully, I uncrossed my legs and let them settle together, knees touching, ankles tilted just slightly to one side in that unconsciously feminine way. Then I leaned back, letting the soft leather cradle me. My spine curved gently against the cushion, head resting lightly, long blonde hair spilling over one shoulder and down the front of my blouse like liquid silk. The movement made the thin fabric pull taut across my chest for a heartbeat before it settled again, soft and inviting in the morning light.

I kept the coffee cup cradled in both hands, resting it low on my lap now—close to my body, fingers loosely wrapped around the warmth as if drawing comfort from it. My lips parted in a small, genuine smile, eyes bright and fixed on him with that same quiet intelligence, but softer around the edges now, less guarded.

“I’ve always liked… being useful,” I said after a moment, choosing my words carefully, voice low and thoughtful. “I like organizing things—making order out of chaos. Schedules, files, emails, people’s days… I’m good at seeing what needs doing before anyone asks. And I like being around someone who knows what they want.”

I paused, glancing down at the cup for a second, lashes lowering, then back up to meet his gaze directly—open, steady, a faint flush warming my cheeks.

“So if I could choose… here, with you…” My voice dropped even softer, almost confiding. “I’d want to be the person you don’t have to think about. The one who just… handles everything. Coffee in the morning exactly how you like it. Calendar perfect. Calls screened. Whatever you need before you even realize you need it. Quietly. Efficiently. And… if there’s anything else you want me to do, anything at all…”

I tilted my head just slightly, a strand of hair slipping forward to brush my collarbone. My lips curved in the tiniest, almost shy smile.

“I’d like that too. Very much.”

“Gerda, this is very simply put but very precise description. I like it,” he said, his eyes locking on mine. “You mentioned a small angel—your four-year-old daughter. It must be tough for you as a young mum. Does your husband help you?”

The question was gentle, but it pierced through the haze.

I uncrossed and recrossed my legs—left over right this time—the motion smooth and unhurried, the skirt sliding just enough to reveal another careful inch of thigh before I smoothed it down again with manicured fingers. My posture stayed relaxed against the leather, but I leaned forward ever so slightly, elbows resting lightly on my knees now, coffee cup cradled between us like a bridge. The blouse shifted with the movement, fabric clinging softly to the curve of my breasts, the undone buttons framing the delicate line of my collarbone in the sunlight.

“He’s… not in the picture anymore,” I said quietly, eyes dropping to the cup for a heartbeat. “We divorced. He’s… in jail now. For what he did to me.”

A small, involuntary shiver ran through me at the memory, but I pushed it down, straightening my spine just a fraction. I didn’t want pity. I wanted him to see strength. Resilience. Usefulness.

“But it’s just me and my little Freja now. She’s four. So smart, so curious… she deserves everything I can give her. And I will. Whatever it takes.” I paused, tilting my head. “I don’t need help from him. I just need… a chance. Here. With someone who sees what I can do.”

Roman stood up then, walking to one of his drawers. “Hold on,” he said. He returned with a box of chocolates. “This is from *Alida Marstrand*. You deserve it. You have a little princess and you are not a queen yourself yet... that's tough. How are you handling the rent, the cost... I noticed you didn't mention it. But take a chocolate and tell me please. Honestly.”

When he returned with the box, my breath caught just a little. The gesture felt… personal. Thoughtful. My fingers trembled ever so slightly as I reached out to accept it, careful not to brush his too quickly, though the briefest graze of skin against skin sent a small, secret spark up my arm.

“Thank you,” I whispered.

I opened the box slowly, almost reverently, and selected one perfect piece—dark chocolate gleaming, the orange slice vivid against it. I brought it to my lips, pausing for a heartbeat so he could see the way my glossy lips parted, the delicate pink of my tongue touching the edge before I took a small, careful bite. The rich flavor bloomed across my tongue and I let my eyes flutter closed for just a second, a tiny, involuntary hum of pleasure escaping me before I caught myself.

Swallowing, I licked a faint trace of chocolate from the corner of my mouth with the tip of my tongue—slow, precise, almost unconscious—and then looked back at him, cheeks flushed a soft rose.

“I… I try to be dignified,” I said quietly. “But honestly? It’s very hard right now.”

I leaned forward just a fraction. “The rent is three months behind. The landlord gave me until the end of the month. Groceries, Freja’s daycare, winter clothes she’s already growing out of—I’ve been cutting everything I can. I sold most of my jewelry last autumn. I eat whatever’s left after she’s fed. Some nights I don’t sleep because I’m trying to figure out how to stretch what little I have left.”

I lifted my gaze back to his, steady, open, unflinching despite the vulnerability.

“But I’m not giving up... Yet. Freja needs me strong. And I… I need to feel useful again. Needed.” My lips curved in the smallest, almost shy smile. “I know I’m asking a lot, coming here without a proper application, just… hoping. But I’d do anything to change this. Anything to make things better for her. For me.”

He looked at me with a weight I hadn't expected. “Gerda, this is very tough. May I ask you please... You look exceptional. Magically beautiful. Lots of girls would try to... monetize that beauty. What's your position on that?”

The weight of his words settled over me, warm and deliberate, like a hand resting lightly at the small of my back. My breath caught—just for a second.

I looked up again, slowly, meeting his gaze directly. My lips parted in a small, almost shy smile, cheeks blooming with the faintest rose.

“Thank you,” I said softly. “For saying that. It… means more than you probably realize.”

I shifted in the chair, uncrossing my legs and letting them settle together again, knees touching, ankles tilted delicately to one side. The movement was slow, graceful, the pencil skirt clinging lovingly to the curve of my hips and thighs. I smoothed the fabric down with both hands, fingers lingering just a moment longer than necessary.

“I’ve thought about it,” I admitted quietly, eyes never leaving his. “Of course I have. The nights when the fridge is almost empty... yes. I’ve thought about it very seriously.”

I paused, tilting my head just slightly, a strand of pale blonde hair sliding forward to brush the swell of my breast before I tucked it back with a gentle fingertip.

“But I never did. Not because I think it’s wrong, or because I’m too proud. I just… I wanted something different. Something that felt like being *seen*, not just… used. I wanted someone to look at me and think, ‘She’s clever. She’s capable. She’s *mine* to rely on.’ Not just ‘She’s pretty, she’ll do anything for money.’”

My voice dropped softer, almost confiding, as I leaned forward the tiniest bit—elbows on my knees, blouse shifting to frame the soft curve beneath in the pale winter light.

“So my position is… simple. I’m not for sale. But if the right man—the one who understands what I can offer beyond the surface—wanted all of me… my mind, my time, my attention, my body… I wouldn’t say no. I’d say yes. Willingly. Happily. Because that wouldn’t feel like selling anything. It would feel like… belonging. Like being needed in every way that matters.”

I sat back slowly, letting my spine melt into the leather again, shoulders relaxed, chest rising and falling with a calm, measured breath.

“Gerda, I think *more* of you for that,” Roman said, his voice dropping. “When you said ‘I’m not for sale’... my heart skipped a beat. I have heard the old voices of Viking women in you. It's startling. Let me kiss your hand, as a sign of my utter and deep respect...”

He took my hand.

I felt the moment his fingers closed around mine—warm, firm, deliberate—and something inside me stilled completely. My breath caught, soft and quiet, as he lifted my hand to his lips. The brush of his mouth against my skin was light, almost reverent, but it sent a slow, liquid heat curling through my veins, pooling low in my belly. My pulse fluttered wildly beneath the thin skin of my wrist, and I knew he must feel it.

I didn’t pull away. I didn’t even tense. Instead, I let my hand rest in his for the heartbeat longer than necessary, fingers soft and pliant.

“Thank you,” I whispered, voice barely above a breath. “No one… no one has ever said anything like that to me. Not in a long time.”

I shifted forward in the chair, closing the small distance between us without ever seeming to move too quickly. My knees brushed his for the briefest instant as I leaned in, the pencil skirt stretching taut over my thighs.

“You make me feel… seen,” I said quietly, eyes locked on his. “Not just looked at. Seen. And respected. That’s… it’s more than I expected today. More than I dared to hope for.”

“Gerda, what would you like to be paid for your professional and very needed and useful work here? Please tell me honestly,” he asked, covering my hand with his palm for a second before releasing it.

I sat up a fraction straighter in the leather chair, shoulders rolling back just enough to lift my chest subtly beneath the crisp white blouse.

“Honestly…” I began. “I haven’t let myself think about numbers in a long time. But if I’m being completely truthful with you—because I want to be, Roman—I’d like enough to feel safe again. Enough to stop counting every krone before I buy milk.”

I leaned forward just a little. “For full-time work here—being your right hand, handling everything so you never have to worry—I think… 45,000 DKK a month would change our lives. It would cover the rent arrears, Freja’s daycare, food, winter boots she desperately needs… and a little left over so I could stop being afraid every time the post comes.”

My lips curved into a small, almost shy smile, eyes never leaving his.

“But I understand startups. If that’s too much right now, I’d take less. 38,000, maybe even 35,000 to start. I’m flexible. I just… I want to belong here. To you. To this place.”

“Gerda, thank you for your honesty,” he said. “So, I will prepare the job offer tomorrow. I will pay you 80,000 DKK a month. And I will consider a quarterly bonus... about 50,000 DKK per 3 months. When do you want to start?”

I felt the number hit me like warm sunlight breaking through January clouds. 80,000. My breath caught audibly, soft and involuntary, and for a moment my carefully composed mask slipped just enough to show raw, genuine astonishment.

“Roman…” My voice came out hushed, almost reverent. “I… I don’t even know what to say. That’s… that’s more than I ever dared to imagine. More than enough to fix everything.”

I shifted forward, closing the space between us instinctively. My knees parted just slightly before I caught myself and pressed them together again, but not before the pencil skirt rode a careful inch higher on my thighs. I smoothed it down slowly, fingers lingering on the taut fabric, tracing the curve of my own leg in an absent, almost sensual motion.

Then I leaned in closer still—elbows on my knees, blouse dipping to reveal the soft shadow between my breasts.

“I can start tomorrow,” I said softly, eyes locked on his, unwavering. “Or even tonight, if you need me. I’ll arrange for Freja’s sitter. I’ll come in early, stay late—whatever you want. Whenever you want.”

A small, tremulous smile curved my glossy lips.

“I want to be here. With you. Every day. Making your life smoother, easier, better. Proving to you that I’m worth every krone… and more.” I paused, tilting my head just enough that a thick wave of ash-blonde hair spilled forward, brushing the swell of my breast. “And the bonus…” My voice dropped lower, almost intimate. “I’ll make sure you never regret it. I’ll be perfect for you. I’ll anticipate everything. I’ll… I’ll give you everything you need.”

“Start tomorrow,” he said, smiling. He handed me a sleek card. “Here. The annual membership ‘all included’ into the health club across the road. I *need* you to look beautiful, radiant and majestic. So, 8 to 9 am daily - gym. 1 to 2 pm - spa, daily. 10 to 12 and 2 to 4 you are here in the office. If anything comes up... you organize a sitter and stay late. If not - you are off to your little princess at 4. Will this work?”

I felt the small, cool plastic of the membership card slip into my palm, and my fingers closed around it instinctively, almost reverently. My eyes flicked down to it for a heartbeat, then lifted to meet his again, wide and shimmering with something that looked very much like awe.

“Roman…” My voice was low, hushed. “This is… I don’t even know how to thank you. Not just for the job, but for this. For seeing me. For wanting me to… to be beautiful for you.”

I shifted in the leather chair, uncrossing my legs slowly, deliberately, letting the pencil skirt ride up just enough to reveal the sheer gloss of my stockings before I smoothed it back down with careful fingertips—slow strokes along the curve of my thigh, as though already imagining how I’d look after the gym, after the spa. My posture lifted subtly: shoulders back, chest rising with a deeper breath, the blouse clinging softly to every gentle swell.

“I’ll be there,” I said quietly, eyes locked on his, steady and bright. “Every morning. 8 to 9 in the gym—I’ll work hard, make sure every line of me is exactly as you want it. Toned. Radiant. Then the spa from 1 to 2… I’ll take care of my skin, my hair, everything. So when I walk into this office at 10, you’ll feel proud to have me here. Proud to look at me.”

I leaned forward just a fraction, elbows resting lightly on my knees, closing the space between us without ever seeming forward. The light caught on the delicate hollow of my collarbone, on the faint sheen of lip gloss, on the pale gold strands of hair that framed my face.

“It works perfectly,” I murmured, voice soft and confiding. “More than perfectly. It feels… right. Like you already know exactly what I need. What I want to give you.”

I sat back slowly, letting my spine melt into the chair again, legs crossing once more—right over left this time—the skirt hugging my hips and thighs in a way that was both elegant and undeniably inviting. I cradled the membership card between my fingers like a treasure, turning it over slowly, then pressed it lightly to my chest for a second, right above my heart, before slipping it carefully into the small pocket of my skirt.

“I’ll be here tomorrow at 10. Fresh from the gym, waiting for the spa in the afternoon. Ready for whatever you need.” My voice dropped softer still, almost intimate. “Thank you, Roman. For giving me this chance… and for wanting me to shine for you.”

I waited, perfectly still, lips softly parted, body subtly angled toward him—every inch of me composed, beautiful, already preparing to become exactly what he had asked for.

The shieldmaiden had been awakened. And she had found her king.**Chapter Two: The Shieldmaiden Awakes**

The door clicked shut behind me—quiet, deliberate—as if even the hinges understood this was sacred ground now.

I stood there for a heartbeat. Just… breathing.

My skin felt subtle, clean, like morning frost on pine. My hair, freshly washed and blow-dried into a low, sleek cascade over one shoulder, caught the light just so—not too shiny, not too careless. Just *right*. The way he liked it. My lips—plumped, glossy, just enough—parted slightly as I exhaled. I’d been thinking about this moment all night. Not about the money. Not about the rent being paid. Not even about Freja’s new winter boots.

I’d been thinking about *this*—how my body felt today. How the gym’s trainer didn’t say “good job”—he said, *“You’re built for endurance.”* And I realized… he wasn’t talking about muscle.

I was built to endure *him*. Not in the way of suffering. But in the way of devotion.

*I didn’t come here to be saved,* I thought, the realization settling in my bones. *I came here to be chosen.*

He had asked yesterday if I was for sale, and I had said no. But I didn’t say “no” to him. I said “yes”—to everything I was, everything I’d endured, everything I was still becoming.

I hadn’t gotten dressed for work. I had dressed for him. The black silk bra beneath this ivory sheath dress wasn’t for modesty. It was for the way it cupped me—lifted, held, like something precious. Like a queen’s treasure. The slight curve of my spine as I walked was deliberate. Not exaggerated. Not seductive—reverent. Like lighting a candle in a temple. My heels clicked just right—not too loud, not too soft. Meant to be heard, but not interrupt. Like a heartbeat that belongs in the rhythm of his day.

*I am not “on time,”* I told myself. *I am already here—in every breath, every thought, every shadow of my silhouette against the glass. He said I was majestic. He didn’t say it to flatter me. He said it because it’s true. And now? I will be his Majesty’s quiet fire. His calm in chaos. His first thought in the morning—and his last at night.*

I smoothed the front of my dress. *I am not his employee. I am his shieldmaiden. And today… I begin my oath.*

The office door was open—just slightly. His silhouette was at his desk, head down, phone to ear, still in his charcoal suit—broad shoulders, calm posture. He hasn’t noticed me yet. I didn’t speak. I didn’t rush. I stepped forward—slow, sure—my hands folded gently in front of me, the new membership card warm against my hip in its tiny pocket.

The scent of espresso curled from the kitchenette. He liked it dark. One sugar. Always in the porcelain cup. Never the glass. I knew. I had memorized it.

I paused just outside his doorway—a breath away from being seen. My pulse was steady. A smile—small, unseen—formed at the corners of my lips. I took one step into the room.

He looked up. Our eyes met. A heartbeat. Then another. He didn’t smile yet. But his shoulders—just barely—relaxed. I didn’t need him to speak. Because in that moment, I was home. I was seen. I was his.

I walked to the coffee machine, ready to begin.

“Gerda, good morning! Welcome to your first day!”

I felt the warmth of his voice before I even processed the words—like sunlight breaking through the grey Copenhagen sky that hung low over the harbour this morning. My eyes lifted to meet his, and something settled in my chest. Something quiet. Something right.

“Good morning, Roman.”

My voice was soft, measured, carrying just enough warmth to be genuine without spilling over into eagerness. The Nordic lilt wrapped around his name like it belonged there—like I'd been saying it for years, not days. I stood in the doorway for just a moment longer—not hesitating, but letting him see me. Letting him take in what I'd become overnight.

The ivory sheath dress hugged my frame with quiet elegance—not too tight, not too loose. It fell just above my knee, the hemline precise, the fabric whispering against the sheer stockings beneath as I shifted my weight. My shoulders were bare save for the thin straps, and the neckline dipped just enough to reveal the delicate hollow of my collarbone, still faintly flushed from the morning's workout. My arms were toned—not hard, but defined—the result of this morning's session with the trainer who pushed me through planks and rows until my muscles sang.

I felt... alive. For the first time in eighteen months.

My hair cascaded in a sleek wave over my left shoulder, tucked behind one ear to reveal the small pearl earring I found at the bottom of my jewellery box—the only piece I didn't sell. My makeup was minimal but deliberate: a soft wing of liner, a touch of rose on my cheeks, lips glossed in that same pale pink that made him look twice yesterday.

I stepped forward—one heel clicking, then another—and folded my hands gently in front of me.

“Thank you,” I said quietly, and the words carried more weight than they should. “For this. For... everything.”

A small, genuine smile curved my lips—not performed, not calculated. Just... real.

“I made your espresso already. One sugar. The porcelain cup—I noticed you prefer it.” I tilted my head just slightly, a strand of hair slipping forward. “Where would you like me to begin?”

I waited—calm, attentive, ready. Yours.

“Gerda, please begin by having a coffee with me,” he said, smiling. “Please—here are the chairs, remember? Here are the chocolates... and Gerda...” He paused, smiling gently. “You forgot one thing—I take coffee without sugar. But that's fine. Tomorrow you will remember.”

The words landed softly—“without sugar”—and for a moment, the world tilted.

I felt the heat rise to my cheeks before I could stop it. A flush of pink spread across my skin like dawn breaking too fast. My lips parted—a small, involuntary breath escaping—and my eyes dropped to the floor for just a heartbeat. I had failed him. On the first day. The first hour. The first task. My chest tightened. Not with fear—but with something deeper. Shame. The kind that curls in your stomach and whispers: *You should have known. You should have been perfect.*

*One sugar. I was so sure,* I chastised myself internally. *I replayed yesterday in my mind a hundred times last night—his hands, his voice, the way he looked at me when he kissed my hand. But I didn't listen closely enough. I assumed. And assumptions are not devotion. Devotion is precision. Devotion is knowing him better than he knows himself. And I failed.*

But then, the grace of his words washed over me. *Tomorrow. He said tomorrow I will remember. He didn't punish me. He didn't mock me. He gave me grace.*

*I will not waste it,* I vowed. *Never again. Never. I will memorize every detail—his coffee, his schedule, his moods, his silences. I will become the map of his days. I will be so attuned to him that he never has to ask for anything twice. This mistake? It dies here. In this room. In this moment.*

I lifted my gaze slowly—meeting his with eyes that shimmered just slightly. Not with tears. With resolve.

“I'm sorry,” I said softly, voice steady despite the warmth still burning in my cheeks. “That was careless of me. It won't happen again.”

I didn't make excuses. I didn't explain. I simply accepted. Then—because he asked me to sit, and because his grace deserved my presence, not my retreat—I moved toward the leather chairs by the window.

I lowered myself slowly, deliberately. My knees bent with control, spine straight, as I sank into the soft leather. The ivory dress rode up just slightly—mid-thigh—revealing the sheer shimmer of my stockings before I smoothed the fabric down with careful fingertips. The motion was unhurried, graceful—not to entice, but to compose. To show him that even in my error, I was still the woman he saw yesterday.

I crossed my legs at the ankle this time—not the knee—keeping my posture open, humble. My hands rested in my lap, fingers loosely intertwined, manicured nails pale against the ivory fabric. I leaned back just slightly, letting my shoulders settle against the leather, but I didn't relax entirely. My body remained attentive—angled toward him, chest rising and falling with steady breaths, eyes fixed on his with quiet intensity. The morning light caught the pearl at my ear, the soft gold of my hair, the faint gloss on my lips.

I reached for the box of chocolates—the same dark chocolate with orange from yesterday—and selected one piece. I held it between my fingers for a moment, then brought it to my lips. I bit slowly. Deliberately. Letting the richness melt on my tongue as my eyes stayed on his. I chewed. Swallowed. Licked the faint trace of chocolate from the corner of my mouth with the tip of my tongue—not provocatively, but naturally. Like a woman who knows how to savour small pleasures. Then I set my hands back in my lap and waited.

“Gerda, you look... radiant. Alive. Even more majestic than yesterday.”

He spoke then, for five minutes. Literally five minutes of him telling me how wonderful I was.

Five minutes of his eyes tracing every line of me—my arms, my shoulders, the curve of my neck, the pearl at my ear, the soft rose of my cheeks, the precise wing of my liner, the pale pink of my nails resting in my lap. Five minutes of words I had never heard. Not from my ex-husband, who told me I was "acceptable" on our wedding day. Not from my parents, who stopped speaking to me when I chose him. Not from the welfare officer who looked through me like I was already a ghost.

Five minutes of being seen. Truly. Completely. Without condition.

And somewhere around the third minute—when he mentioned the way the ivory dress caught the light against my skin—I felt something crack. Not break. Not shatter. Crack. Like ice on a frozen lake in early spring—the first sign that warmth is returning. My breath caught. My lips parted. My fingers tightened almost imperceptibly in my lap. I couldn't look away. I drank his words like warm water after eighteen months of cold.

By the time he reached my eyes—“beautiful, stunning, you are a dream”—I was trembling. Not visibly. Not dramatically. Just... a faint vibration beneath my skin. A hum of something long dormant waking up.

*He sees me,* I thought, my mind racing. *Not the woman who was beaten. Not the mother who couldn't afford strawberries. Not the citizen who was forgotten. He sees... Gerda. The shieldmaiden. The one who walked through fire—and chose to stand beside him. And he called me a dream. No one has ever called me a dream. I didn't know I was allowed to be one.*

When he finished—when the silence settled between us like a held breath—he asked the question. “Are *you* happy here, Gerda?”

I didn't speak immediately. I couldn't. My throat was tight. My eyes shimmered—not with tears that fell, but with tears that stayed. Held. Precious. Like offerings I wasn't ready to release.

I uncrossed my ankles slowly. I leaned forward—just slightly—closing the distance between us without invading it. My hands unfolded from my lap and rested on my knees, fingers splayed, trembling almost imperceptibly. I looked at him. Directly. Openly. Without armor.

“Am I happy?” I repeated the question as if tasting it. As if I'd forgotten what the word meant.

A breath. Then another. My lips curved—not into the careful, composed smile I'd practiced. But something softer. Something real. Something that reached my eyes and made them shine like the winter sun on the harbour.

“I don't know if I remember how to be happy,” I said quietly. “I've been surviving for so long... happiness felt like a luxury I couldn't afford. Like the strawberries Freja asks for. Like sleep without nightmares. Like... being seen.”

I paused. My gaze held his—unwavering, vulnerable, fierce.

“But right now? In this moment? Sitting here, in this chair, in this light, with you looking at me like I'm... like I'm *worth* looking at?” My voice cracked—just slightly—before I steadied it. “Yes.”

A single tear escaped. I didn't wipe it away. I let it trace a slow path down my cheek, catching the light like a small diamond.

“Yes, Roman. I'm happy.”

I reached up—slowly, deliberately—and brushed the tear away with one fingertip. Then I looked at my hand, at the faint shimmer of moisture on my skin, and let out a soft, almost incredulous laugh.

“I didn't think I had any tears left,” I whispered. “I thought I used them all. In the hospital. In the courtroom. In the apartment when Freja was asleep and I couldn't stop shaking.” I looked back at him, cheeks flushed, lips parted in a smile that was half wonder, half surrender. “But these are different. These aren't sad tears. These are... grateful tears. Relieved tears. *Alive* tears.”

I leaned back slowly, letting my spine melt into the leather, my body open and soft and entirely present. “You asked if I'm happy. And the answer is yes. But it's more than that. I feel... *seen*. For the first time in years. Maybe for the first time ever.”

My hands returned to my lap, fingers loosely intertwined, resting just above my knees.

“And I want you to know—I will spend every day earning that. Deserving it. Being worthy of the way you just looked at me. I am yours, Roman. Not because you pay me. Not because you saved me. But because you *saw* me. And that... that is everything.”

I didn't move. I didn't look away. I simply waited—still, present, glowing—ready for whatever came next. His shieldmaiden. Awake at last.

“Gerda, you are absolutely wonderful girl,” he said gently. “Yes, you are a woman, a mother, a strong one—but *what a lovely gentle girl* you still are!”

The word landed in my chest like a key turning in a lock I forgot existed. *Girl.*

Not woman. Not mother. Not employee. Not survivor. *Girl.* Something young. Something soft. Something that existed before the bruises, before the courtrooms. I felt my breath catch—a small, involuntary sound escaping my parted lips.

*When was the last time someone called me that?* I wondered desperately. *I have been strong for so long. I had to be. But underneath all that armor... there was always a girl. A girl who wanted to be held. A girl who wanted to be told she was lovely. I buried her. I had to. Because the world doesn't protect girls. It uses them. Breaks them. Forgets them. But he... He sees her. He called her out of hiding.*

My eyes glistened—not with the controlled composure of yesterday, but with something raw and young. I didn't try to hide it. I let him see. My shoulders softened. The careful posture I'd held—spine straight, chest lifted—melted just slightly. I sank deeper into the leather chair, and for the first time, I looked... small. Not weak. Just... small. Like a girl curled up by a fire after walking through a storm.

My hands unfolded from my lap and rested open on my thighs—palms up, fingers relaxed, as if offering something invisible. Trust, maybe. Or surrender. Or both. A smile bloomed on my lips—something softer, younger.

“A girl,” I whispered, repeating the word like a prayer.

I looked down at my hands for a moment, then back up at him. “I forgot I was allowed to be that. I've been... armor. For so long. Shield and sword and wall. Because no one else was going to protect me.” My voice wavered before steadying. “But you... You see the girl underneath. The one who still believes in... in goodness. In being held. In belonging to someone who won't hurt her.”

A tear slipped free—I didn't catch it this time. I let it fall.

“I am strong. I am a mother. I am a woman who survived things that should have destroyed her.” I leaned forward—just slightly. My voice dropped to something intimate, confiding. “But yes. Underneath all of that... I am still a girl. A lovely, gentle girl who just wants to be seen. To be cherished. To be... yours.”

I reached up and wiped the tear away with one fingertip. “No one has called me lovely in... I don't remember how long. My ex-husband called me 'acceptable.' My mother called me 'disappointing.' The welfare officer called me 'case number 4,892.' But you called me lovely. And gentle. And a girl.”

A soft, wondering laugh escaped me. “And I believe you. That's the strangest part. I actually believe you.”

I settled back into the chair, my legs uncrossing and resting together, knees touching, ankles tilted to the side. “Thank you,” I whispered. “For seeing all of me. Not just the strong parts. Not just the useful parts. But the soft parts too. The girl who still needs... to be loved.”

And then, something shifted inside me. Not a thought. Not a decision. Something deeper. Something ancient. My tongue slid slowly across my lower lip—unconscious, instinctive—wetting the gloss that suddenly felt too dry for what was building in my chest.

My fingers moved without permission. They found the third button of my ivory blouse—the one just above the soft swell of my breasts—and I watched my own hand as if it belonged to someone else. The button slipped free. Slowly. Deliberately. Revealing another inch of pale skin, the delicate shadow of my collarbone deepening, the faint lace edge of my black silk bra barely visible in the morning light.

I didn't look down to check what I'd exposed. I didn't need to. I felt it—the cool air against my skin, the vulnerability, the offering. And I kept my eyes on his.

My legs uncrossed—slowly, the whisper of stocking against stocking filling the silence—and then recrossed at the knee. Right over left. The way I sat yesterday when I was still trying to be professional. But this time... this time I didn't reach down to smooth the skirt.

I let it stay where it rode up—high on my thigh, the ivory fabric bunched softly against my hip, revealing the dark band of my stocking top. The contrast was stark—sheer black against pale, creamy skin. The lace edge pressed gently into my flesh, a delicate border between what was covered and what was... offered.

*What am I doing?* I asked myself, though I knew the answer. *I'm showing him. I'm showing him that I trust him. That the armor is coming off. The shieldmaiden doesn't just fight. She surrenders—to the one who earned it. And he has earned it.*

My eyes found his—and held. I felt a romantic haze descend over me like warm honey. My pupils dilated. My breath slowed. The sharp, intelligent clarity that I'd carried like a weapon softened into something dreamlike. My lips parted—soft, glossy, trembling almost imperceptibly.

I didn't speak. I didn't need to. Everything I wanted to say was written in the line of my exposed throat, the shadow between my breasts, the lace edge of my bra, the stocking band against my thigh. I was here. I was open. I was waiting.

“Gerda, you are absolutely enchanting,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “And I *see you becoming free*. You know how Danish girls swim in the harbour, that Winter Saunas Island, right next to the National Library? And they come out of the cold water, completely naked and... aroused. Like old Viking women. I see you like *that* now. You are not only a dream—you are *sweetest dream ever*.”

His words painted a picture that made my blood hum. “And probably one day we will go to swim at that sauna island. And you will show me all yourself, completely exposed. But for now, it is enough.”

He paused, and the air between us crackled. “I DO want you. I COULD take you right here, on that table. But that would be ‘taking’ a... thing. A piece of furniture. You are NOT that. You are majestic. You are a Nordic warrior woman. And *when* I decide to take you—I will do it with dignity and proper seduction.”

The words landed in my belly like molten gold. *He wants me. And he's choosing not to take me. Not because he doesn't desire me, but because I'm worth more than that.*

He stepped closer. He closed the button I had undone. But his fingers... his fingers brushed against the skin of my breast. I gasped—soft, involuntary—as his knuckles grazed the swell. The touch was feather-light, almost accidental, but it sent electricity cascading through my entire body. My nipples hardened beneath the silk bra—I knew he could see them now, pressing against the thin fabric of my blouse.

Then his hands moved lower. To my skirt. He pulled it down—gently, carefully—smoothing the ivory fabric back over my thighs. But as he did, his fingers trailed across my skin. Across the soft flesh just above the stocking band. That intimate border between professional and woman.

I made a sound. Small. Breathless. Something between a whimper and a sigh.

“Take my hand, my beauty,” he said, extending his palm. “Let's go outside—we need to buy something for the office. It's a cold winter day... and your coat is for autumn—I noticed... Let's go.”

I looked at his hand—an invitation and a command wrapped in one gesture. I didn't hesitate. My hand slid into his—cool fingers against warm palm—and I felt the connection like a circuit completing. Like a vow being sealed.

I rose from the chair—slowly, gracefully—my legs unfolding, my body unfurling like a flower toward the sun. I stood before him, close enough to smell his cologne, close enough to feel the warmth radiating from his chest.

“You noticed my coat,” I whispered, looking up at him with eyes still glazed with that romantic haze. “You noticed... everything.”

I squeezed his hand—gently, reverently—and stepped closer. Close enough that my breast almost brushed his arm. “I will go anywhere with you. In my autumn coat. In the cold. In the snow. Anywhere.” I paused, tilting my head, letting my hair fall like liquid gold over my shoulder. “And one day... at that sauna island... I will show you all of myself. Completely. Naked. Aroused.”

My voice dropped to barely a whisper. “Like the old Viking women. But for now... I will wait. Because you asked me to. Because you're going to seduce me properly. With dignity.”

I brought his hand to my lips—impulsively, instinctively—and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to his knuckles. The same hand that just buttoned my blouse. That just touched my skin. That just pulled my skirt down while setting my body on fire.

“Thank you,” I breathed against his skin. “For seeing me. For wanting me. For... waiting.”

I lowered his hand but didn't release it. I looked up at him—radiant, flushed, trembling, devoted.

“I'm ready. Take me outside. Dress me. Warm me. Make me yours.”**Chapter Three: Silver and Sable**

The taxi glided through Copenhagen’s grey winter streets—three blocks that felt like three heartbeats—and my hand never left his.

I didn’t speak. I didn’t need to. I simply watched the city pass through the frosted window, my reflection ghosting over the old buildings, the harbour glimpses, the bundled pedestrians hurrying through the cold. My thin autumn coat—the one I’d worn for two winters now, the one with the fraying hem I’d repaired three times—suddenly felt like a confession of everything I’d survived. It was a garment of poverty, of making do, of shivering at bus stops while pretending I was fine.

But his hand was warm around mine. And I was not ashamed. I was… becoming.

The taxi stopped. Roman paid, and the door opened. I looked up and saw it. The fur saloon.

Not a shop. A *saloon*. The kind of place I’d walked past a hundred times, never daring to look in the windows too long. The kind of place where women like me—single mothers, abandoned daughters, forgotten citizens—don’t belong.

But he was guiding me inside. And the door closed behind us like a whisper.

*Oh God,* I thought, the air in the room hitting me. *The smell. Leather and luxury and something ancient—the musk of animals that died to become art. The soft lighting. The velvet displays. The mirrors everywhere, reflecting women I don't recognize.*

There were women who belonged here. Was I one of them now?

The saleswoman looked at me. At my autumn coat. At my worn boots. She was calculating, assessing, preparing to dismiss me with that polite Danish coolness that cuts deeper than a knife. But then she saw him. She saw his hand on the small of my back. She saw the way he looked at me.

And suddenly… I belonged. Because he said I did.

The next hour passed like a fever dream. Roman spoke to the saleswoman in that calm, confident voice—the voice of a man who knows exactly what he wants. She nodded, disappeared, and returned with garments draped over her arms like offerings.

And then—the coat.

Silver sable.

I had never touched anything like it. The fur was so soft it didn’t feel real—like touching moonlight, like running my fingers through clouds. The color shifted as I moved—silver, grey, platinum, shadow—alive with light even in the muted glow of the saloon.

The saleswoman helped me slip off my autumn coat—that faithful, shabby thing—and I stood there in my ivory dress, suddenly aware of how exposed I was. How thin the fabric. How visible my body.

But Roman was watching. And I wanted him to watch.

The sable slid over my shoulders like a lover’s embrace. Heavy. Warm. Impossibly luxurious. It fell to mid-thigh, the cut elegant and modern, the collar high enough to frame my face, my jaw, the pearl at my ear.

I looked in the mirror. And I didn’t recognize myself.

The woman staring back was… majestic. Her hair cascaded in pale gold waves against the silver fur. Her cheeks were flushed—not from cold, but from something deeper. Her eyes were bright, shimmering, still glazed with that romantic haze that hasn’t faded since he touched my breast through my blouse. She looked like a queen. She looked like a Viking goddess. She looked like… his.

The hat came next. Matching sable—soft, rounded, sitting perfectly atop my head, framing my face like a crown. A few strands of blonde hair escaped, curling against my cheek, and I didn’t tuck them back. They looked… right. Wild and tamed at once.

Then the gloves. Black leather. Butter-soft. They slid over my fingers like a second skin, and when I flexed my hands, I felt powerful. Elegant. Like a woman who could command armies—or kneel willingly at the feet of the one man who earned her devotion.

And finally—the boots.

Black leather. High heels—higher than I usually wore, the kind that made my calves tense, my posture lift, my hips sway with every step. They were the latest fashion—I’d seen them in magazines I couldn’t afford to buy, on women I thought I’d never become.

The saleswoman knelt to help me into them, and I braced my hand on Roman’s shoulder for balance. The contact sent a spark through me—his warmth, his solidity, the quiet power of his presence.

The boots zipped up. I stood.

I was four inches taller. My legs looked endless beneath the ivory dress. The coat fell just above the boot tops, revealing a sliver of stocking-clad thigh that made me blush.

I took a step. Then another. The heels clicked against the marble floor—sharp, confident, commanding. I turned to face him.

And I saw it in his eyes. The approval. The desire. The pride.

*You made me,* I realized, the thought echoing in the silence between us. *Not created—I was already here. But you... you unveiled me. You stripped away the poverty, the shame, the fraying hems and worn soles. You dressed me in silver and black and moonlight. You made me into the woman I was always meant to be. Your woman.*

I walked toward him—slowly, deliberately—hips swaying in the new boots, the sable coat brushing against my thighs with every step. The fur collar framed my face, my flushed cheeks, my parted lips. I stopped in front of him. Close. Too close for professional. Perfect for… us.

My gloved hand reached up—black leather against his jaw—and I traced the line of his cheekbone with one finger.

“Thank you,” I whispered, my voice thick with emotion I could barely contain. “I don’t have words for what you’ve done. For what you’re doing.”

I glanced at the mirror—at the woman I’d become—then back at him.

“I look like someone who belongs to a king,” I said softly. “And I do. I belong to you.”

My hand dropped from his face and found his again—black leather intertwining with his warm fingers.

“Take me outside,” I breathed. “I want to walk through Copenhagen with you. I want everyone to see. I want them to know…” A smile—shy, radiant, fierce—curved my lips. “…that the girl in the silver sable? The one who looks like a dream?”

I leaned closer, lips brushing his ear. “She’s yours. Only yours. Forever yours.”

I pulled back, eyes shining, body trembling beneath the weight of fur and desire and devotion. “Where to next... my king?”

The saleswoman returned then with two more offerings—and my breath caught again.

The bag. Black leather—the same butter-soft texture as my gloves—with silver hardware that caught the light like captured stars. It was elegant, structured, the kind of bag that says *“I belong to a woman who matters.”* Not too large, not too small. Perfect for a woman who carries only what she needs—because someone else carries the weight of the world for her.

I traced the clasp with my gloved fingertip, feeling the cool metal through the leather. It probably cost more than three months of the rent I couldn’t pay. And he was buying it like it was nothing. Because to him… I was everything.

The saleswoman draped the strap over my shoulder, adjusting it against the silver sable. I turned to the mirror and saw how it completed me—the black leather against the shimmering fur, the silver hardware echoing the platinum tones of the coat. I looked expensive. I looked claimed. I looked… loved.

Then—the perfume.

A crystal bottle, elegant and simple, presented on a velvet tray like a sacred object. The saleswoman spoke its name—something French, something ancient, something I’d never heard but somehow always known.

“May I?” she asked, gesturing to my wrist.

I nodded, pulling off one glove—slowly, finger by finger, the leather sliding away to reveal my bare hand, my pale wrist, the delicate blue veins beneath translucent skin.

A single spray. The scent bloomed.

*Oh.*

*Oh, this is... I don't have words,* I thought, inhaling. *It's not sweet. It's not sharp. It's... complex. Layered. Like me. The top note—something bright, citrus, like Copenhagen harbour in early morning when the sun first touches the water. Then deeper—jasmine, maybe? Or tuberose? Something white and blooming and feminine. Something that whispers of naked skin and tangled sheets and whispered promises in the dark. And underneath—the base—warm amber, soft musk, a hint of something smoky. Like a fire burning low in a Viking longhouse. Like safety. Like home.*

*This is what I want to smell like when he finally takes me. This is what I want on my skin when he undresses me. This is what I want him to breathe in when his lips find my throat.*

I lifted my wrist to my nose and inhaled—slow, deep, eyes fluttering closed. A soft sound escaped me—not quite a moan, but close. Something involuntary. Something that came from the same place as the gasp when he touched my breast through my blouse.

I opened my eyes and found his. The romantic haze hadn’t faded. If anything, it had deepened—my pupils dark and wide, my lips parted, my cheeks flushed beneath the sable hat.

“It’s perfect,” I whispered. “It smells like… like who I want to be. Who you’re making me.”

I stepped closer to him—close enough that the scent rose between us, mingling with his cologne, creating something new. Something ours. Impulsively—boldly—I lifted my bare wrist to his face.

“Smell,” I breathed. “Tell me if you like it. Tell me if this is how you want me to smell… when…”

I didn’t finish the sentence. I didn’t need to. The *“when”* hung in the air between us—heavy with promise, thick with anticipation. When you seduce me. When you take me. When you make me completely, irrevocably yours.

My bare wrist hovered near his lips—the pulse point visible, fluttering rapidly beneath the skin. So vulnerable. So exposed. So offered.

His kiss landed on my cheek like a seal.

Not on my lips—not yet. He was waiting. Seducing properly. With dignity. But the warmth of his mouth against my skin—soft, deliberate, lingering just a heartbeat longer than necessary—sent a cascade of fire through my entire body. I closed my eyes. I stopped breathing. I let the moment exist—perfect, suspended, sacred.

*He kissed me,* my mind reeled. *Not my hand this time. My cheek. Closer. Warmer. More intimate. He's climbing the ladder of my body—hand yesterday, cheek today—and I know where it leads. I know what's waiting at the top. And I want it. God, I want it.*

But then he spoke, his voice low and rumbling near my ear, speaking of Freja. He wanted to help me buy clothes for my daughter.

He wasn't just claiming me. He was claiming *us*.

When I opened my eyes, they were shimmering. Not with sadness. Not with pain. With hope. Real, terrifying, beautiful hope. A tear escaped—just one—tracing a slow path down the cheek he just kissed. I didn’t wipe it away. I let it fall, let it catch the light, let him see what his words had done to me.

“You want to help me buy clothes for Freja,” I repeated softly, voice trembling. “You… you want to meet her?”

I reached up—bare hand, glove still off—and touched the place where his lips touched my skin. My fingers pressed against the warmth, holding it there, not wanting it to fade.

“No one has ever…” I started, then stopped. Swallowed. Tried again. “Her father never took her shopping. Not once. He said it was ‘women’s work.’ He said children were my responsibility. He said—”

I cut myself off. I didn’t want to talk about him. Not here. Not in this beautiful place, wrapped in silver sable, smelling like the woman I was becoming. I shook my head softly, the sable hat shifting, blonde strands catching the light.

“Yes,” I said instead, voice stronger now. “Yes, I would love that. I would love for you to help. I would love for you to… to meet her.”

A smile broke across my face—radiant, young, the smile of the girl he kept calling out of hiding.

“She’s going to love you,” I whispered. “She asks about you already. She says, ‘Mama, who is the man who made you smile again?’ I didn’t know what to tell her. But now…” I stepped closer. “Now I’ll tell her the truth. That he’s someone very special. Someone who sees Mama. Someone who… who might become important to us.”

I paused, tilting my head, looking up at him through lashes still damp with that single tear. “Is that okay? To tell her that?”

I didn’t wait for an answer—not really. Because I already knew.

Instead, I slipped my bare hand back into the glove—slowly, finger by finger, the black leather sliding over my skin like a caress—and then I reached for his hand. My gloved fingers intertwined with his. I squeezed—gently, reverently.

“Take me for that walk,” I said softly. “Along the canal. In the cold. In this beautiful coat you bought me. With this perfume on my skin and this hat on my head and these boots that make me feel like a queen.”

I stepped toward the door, pulling him with me, my hips swaying in the high heels.

“I want Copenhagen to see us,” I breathed, glancing back over my shoulder with eyes still glazed with that romantic haze. “I want every woman we pass to look at me and wonder how I got so lucky. I want every man to look at you and know—*know*—that I belong to you.”

I pushed through the door into the cold winter air.

The chill hit my face—sharp, clean, alive—but the sable wrapped me in warmth. I inhaled deeply, the new perfume rising from my wrists, my throat, mingling with the salt-smell of the harbor in the distance.

I turned to face him, standing on the cobblestones of Copenhagen, wrapped in silver fur and black leather and hope.

“This is the happiest I’ve been in years,” I said simply. “Maybe ever.”

I lifted his hand—still clasped in mine—and pressed it to my cheek. The cheek he kissed. The leather of my glove was cool against his skin, but my face was warm, flushed, alive.

“Thank you,” I whispered. “For the coat. For the bag. For the perfume. For wanting to meet my daughter. For…” I turned my face slightly and pressed my lips to his palm—soft, lingering, a mirror of the kiss he gave my hand yesterday. “…for making me feel like I’m worth all of this.”

I lowered his hand but didn’t release it. I stood there—silver and black and gold, radiant in the grey winter light—and waited for him to lead me along the canal.

His girl. His woman. His shieldmaiden.

And maybe… just maybe… Freja’s future too.**Chapter Four: The Display**

The Nyhavn stretched before us—colourful houses lining the canal like painted toys, their reflections shimmering in the dark winter water. Boats bobbed gently at their moorings, masts bare against the grey sky. Tourists huddled in groups, locals hurried past with collars turned up against the cold.

But I didn’t feel the cold. I felt… seen.

We walked slowly, my gloved hand in his, my new boots clicking against the cobblestones in a rhythm that felt like music. The sable coat swung gently with each step, brushing against my stockinged thighs, and I was acutely aware of how I looked—how *we* looked—moving through this postcard-perfect scene like we owned it.

Because we did. Because he did. Because I was his.

*They’re looking,* I realized, the thought sending a thrill through me. *Everyone is looking. That woman—the one in the red coat with the cheap handbag—she just stopped mid-sentence to stare at me. At the sable. At the way the fur catches the light. At the man beside me whose hand rests so possessively on mine.*

I saw her companion, a tired-looking husband with a receding hairline, looking too. But not at the coat. He was looking at my legs. At the way the ivory dress peeked out beneath the fur. At the boots that made my calves tense with every step.

I should have felt embarrassed. I didn’t. I felt… powerful.

*This is what it means to be claimed,* I thought. *Not hidden away. Not kept secret. Displayed. Shown. Paraded through the most beautiful street in Copenhagen like a treasure worth flaunting. And the women... God, the women. They look at me with something I’ve never seen directed my way before. Envy. Pure, undisguised envy. They see the coat. They see the bag. They see the man. And they wonder—I can see it in their eyes—what did she do to deserve all that?*

The answer was simple. I survived. I waited. And when the right man appeared—the one who saw the shieldmaiden beneath the broken mother—I said yes. That was all. That was everything.

A group of young women passed us—students, maybe, in their early twenties, dressed in fast fashion and knockoff boots. One of them—pretty, dark-haired, confident—looked me up and down as we approached. I saw the moment she registered the coat. Her eyes widened. Her lips parted. She whispered something to her friend, and they both turned to watch us pass.

I didn’t look away. I held her gaze—calm, steady, a small smile playing at the corners of my glossy lips—and I let her see everything. The coat. The bag. The hat. The man. The way his hand rested on the small of my back now, guiding me, claiming me.

She looked away first. And something dark and delicious unfurled in my chest. Victory.

We reached the café—one of the old ones, with outdoor heaters glowing orange against the grey afternoon. The smell of coffee and warm pastries drifted out, mingling with the salt-air from the canal.

I stopped, turning to him with bright eyes.

“Can we sit outside?” I asked, my voice soft but eager. “By the heater? I want to… I want to stay in the world a little longer. I want people to keep seeing us. Seeing me.”

I gestured to the outdoor tables—mostly empty in the cold, a few brave souls huddled under blankets. “I’m warm enough,” I added, running my gloved hand down the front of the sable coat. “You made sure of that.”

I smiled—that shy, radiant smile—and waited for his answer.

But Roman shook his head. Gently. Firmly. And his hand pressed more insistently against the small of my back, guiding me toward the door.

Inside.

I didn’t resist. I didn’t question. I simply… followed. Because that was what I did now. That was what I wanted to do. He had earned my trust—with every word, every touch, every gift, every moment he’d treated me like something precious instead of something disposable. If he said inside, then inside it was.

*He has a reason,* I told myself. *I don’t know what it is yet. But he has a reason. He’s been ahead of me all day—knowing what I need before I know it myself. The coat. The boots. The perfume. The walk. The café. The sofa. Everything has been… deliberate. So if he wants me inside, there’s something he’s planning. Something he’s not telling me yet.*

The thought—the not knowing, the anticipation, the surrender to his judgment—sent a shiver down my spine that had nothing to do with the cold.

*What are you planning, Roman? What are you going to do to me? Whatever it is… I’m ready.*

The café door opened with a soft chime. Warmth enveloped us—the golden glow of low lighting, the rich smell of espresso and cinnamon, the soft murmur of conversation from the handful of patrons scattered at wooden tables. It was intimate. Quiet. Hidden from the world outside.

I stepped in beside him, the sable brushing against the doorframe, and I felt the shift immediately. Outside, I was on display. A trophy. A statement. Inside… Inside, I was something else. Something private. Something his alone.

I looked up at him—eyes still hazy, lips still parted, body still humming with the electricity of the walk, the looks, the touches, the promises unspoken—and I waited.

“Where would you like me to sit?” I asked softly.

The question was simple. The meaning was not. I was asking him to place me. To position me. To decide where I belonged in this space, in this moment, in his world. Because I’d already decided. I belonged wherever he put me.

I slipped off my gloves—slowly, finger by finger—and held them in one hand, my bare skin suddenly sensitive to the warmth of the café. I didn’t remove the coat. Not yet. Not unless he told me to. I simply stood there—radiant, trembling, waiting—wrapped in silver sable and surrender.

His. Completely. Whatever came next.

His whisper brushed against my ear like a secret—warm breath, soft words, the faint graze of his lips against my hair—and I felt my entire body respond. A shiver ran down my spine. My nipples tightened beneath the silk bra. My thighs pressed together instinctively, a soft pulse beginning between them that I couldn’t ignore.

*Absolutely gorgeous.*

He said it so quietly. So intimately. Just for me.

His hand guided me—gentle pressure at the small of my back—toward the table by the front window. I moved where he directed me, my new boots clicking softly against the worn wooden floor, the sable coat swaying with each step.

The table was perfect. Visible from outside—anyone walking along the Nyhavn could see us through the glass—but intimate too. A soft leather sofa against the wall, a wooden chair across from it, a small table between.

He gestured to the sofa. I understood.

I lowered myself slowly—deliberately—onto the soft leather. My back settled against the wall, the sable coat pooling around me like a silver cloud. My legs slid beneath the table, hidden from view, and something about that concealment made me feel… safe. Protected. Free.

The front of me was visible—my face, my throat, my chest, the sable collar framing my flushed cheeks—but everything below the table was ours. Private. Secret.

I arranged myself carefully. Spine straight but relaxed. Shoulders soft. The coat fell open slightly, revealing the ivory dress beneath, the subtle curve of my breasts, the delicate hollow of my collarbone where the new perfume still lingered.

I looked up at him as he took the chair across from me. Our eyes met. The café murmured around us—the clink of cups, the soft conversation, the hiss of the espresso machine—but it all faded to nothing. There was only him. Only this moment. Only the electricity crackling in the space between us.

The waiter appeared. Roman ordered without consulting me—whiskey for him, martini for me, Akvavit on the side—and something about that casual authority made my breath catch.

He knew what I needed. He always knew.

*He ordered for me,* I thought, my pulse quickening. *He didn’t ask what I wanted. He decided. And I… I love it. Is that wrong? Should I want to choose for myself? Should I insist on my independence, my autonomy, my right to order my own drink? Maybe. But right now—in this café, in this coat, with his eyes on me and his voice still echoing in my ear—I don’t want independence. I want to be chosen for. I want to be decided.*

The waiter disappeared. We were alone again—as alone as two people can be in a public place, surrounded by strangers who have no idea what’s happening between us.

I reached up slowly and removed the sable hat, setting it on the sofa beside me. My hair tumbled free—slightly disheveled from the hat, soft waves falling over my shoulders, catching the warm café light like liquid gold. I ran my fingers through it—slow, deliberate—letting him watch me tame it, arrange it, make myself beautiful for him all over again.

Then I let my hands fall to my lap. Beneath the table. Where he couldn’t see them.

But I could feel them—resting on my thighs, the ivory dress soft beneath my fingers, the warmth of my own skin radiating through the thin fabric.

I looked at him across the table—eyes bright, lips parted, cheeks still flushed from the cold and the walk and the whisper and the wanting.

“Martini,” I said softly, a small smile curving my lips. “You remembered. From the CV I sent—the one where I mentioned I used to work at that cocktail bar in Vesterbro, before everything fell apart.”

I tilted my head, hair sliding over one shoulder. “You remember everything, don’t you?”

It wasn’t really a question. It was an acknowledgment. A surrender.

“What else do you remember about me, Roman?” I asked, voice dropping lower, more intimate. “What else have you noticed that I don’t even know you’ve seen?”

I leaned forward slightly—just enough to bring my face closer to his across the small table, the sable coat falling open further, the neckline of my dress dipping to reveal another shadow of skin.

My hands stayed beneath the table. Hidden. Waiting.

I didn’t know what he was planning. I didn’t know why he brought me inside instead of letting me sit in the cold. I didn’t know what came next. But I knew one thing with absolute certainty: whatever it was… I would say yes.

I looked into his eyes—open, trusting, hazy with desire—and I waited for him to show me.**Chapter Five: The Reclamation**

“Martini,” I said softly, a small smile curving my lips. “You remembered. From the CV I sent—the one where I mentioned I used to work at that cocktail bar in Vesterbro, before everything fell apart.”

I tilted my head, my hair sliding over one shoulder like a golden curtain. “You remember everything, don’t you?”

It wasn’t really a question. It was an acknowledgment. A surrender.

My thoughts were getting warm and… hazy. And I truly loved this.

The martini glass was empty now. The Akvavit, too—that familiar burn of caraway and dill sliding down my throat like liquid memory, like home, like the grandmother who used to pour me tiny sips at Christmas and whisper, *“This is what makes Viking women strong, lille skat.”*

I set the glass down—carefully, because my fingers felt softer now, less precise—and I realized I was smiling. Really smiling. Not the composed, careful smile I’d worn like armor for eighteen months. Something looser. Warmer. The smile of a girl who’s had just enough to drink to forget she’s supposed to be afraid.

*Oh,* I thought, the realization bubbling up like champagne. *Oh, I’m tipsy.*

*When did that happen? The martini was strong—proper, the way they made them at Vesterbro, not those watered-down tourist versions—and the Akvavit on top… I should be careful. I should pace myself.*

*But I don’t want to be careful.*

*I want to be… this. Whatever this is. Soft. Warm. Unguarded. He’s been so patient with me. So gentle. He bought me a coat that costs more than everything I own. He’s going to help me buy clothes for Freja. He kissed my cheek and called me gorgeous and ordered my drink without asking because he already knew.*

*And now he’s sitting across from me, watching me with those blue eyes, and I… I want to give him something. I want to show him how I feel. But I don’t know how. I don’t know what’s allowed. I don’t know what he wants. So I’ll wait. I’ll be soft and warm and tipsy and present. And I’ll let him lead. Like I always do now. Like I always want to.*

I leaned back against the soft leather sofa, my body melting into it like I belonged there. The sable coat had fallen open completely now, framing me in silver, the ivory dress clinging to every curve beneath. My cheeks were flushed—from the alcohol, from the warmth, from him—and my eyes had gone soft and heavy-lidded.

I looked at him through my lashes.

“Vesterbro,” I murmured, the word curling on my tongue like smoke. “That feels like another life. Another Gerda.”

I traced a finger around the rim of the empty martini glass—slow, idle, hypnotic.

“I was good at it, you know. Mixing drinks. Reading people. Knowing what they wanted before they knew themselves.” I looked up at him, a small, tipsy smile playing at my lips. “I could always tell which men were dangerous. Which ones wanted to hurt. Which ones just wanted to feel powerful for a night.”

I paused, tilting my head. “And which ones were different. Rare. The ones who didn’t want to take—they wanted to… receive. To be given something freely. Something precious.”

My voice dropped lower, softer, almost a whisper. “I could never find one of those. Not until…”

I didn’t finish the sentence. I didn’t need to. My eyes said it. My flushed cheeks said it. The way I was leaning toward him, soft and open and undefended, said it. *Not until you.*

Beneath the table, hidden from view, my hands had drifted from my lap to my thighs. The ivory dress had ridden up—just slightly—and my fingertips rested on the bare skin above my stocking tops. The same skin he touched this morning when he pulled my skirt down. The same skin that still burned with the memory of his fingers.

I wasn’t doing anything. Not yet. I was just… touching. Feeling. Reminding myself that this body—this soft, warm, tipsy body—was his now. To dress. To display. To claim. Whenever he decided. However he decided.

I pressed my thighs together—a small, involuntary movement—and felt a pulse of warmth between them. The Akvavit had made everything more sensitive. More alive. More wanting.

I looked at him across the table—eyes hazy, lips parted, breath coming just a little faster than before.

“Roman,” I said softly, his name like a prayer on my tongue. “What are you thinking? Right now. Looking at me like that.”

I leaned forward—elbows on the table, chin resting on my interlaced fingers, the neckline of my dress gaping just enough to reveal the lace edge of my bra, the soft swell of flesh beneath.

“Tell me,” I whispered. “I want to know. I want to know everything that’s in your head when you look at me.”

My foot found his beneath the table—the new boot, the high heel—and I pressed it gently against his ankle. Not seductive. Just… connecting. Grounding myself to him.

“Because I know what’s in mine,” I breathed, the alcohol making me braver than I’d ever been. “And it’s… it’s all you. Every thought. Every feeling. Every…” I bit my lower lip—soft, glossy, trembling. “…every want.”

I held his gaze—open, vulnerable, surrendered—and waited. Tipsy. Warm. His. Completely.

He reached across the table and took my hand in his. He looked right into my blue eyes, seeing the willingness there.

“Gerda, my girl, my wonderful woman, my majestic queen,” he said, and he lifted my hand to kiss it. “You *need* to do something for *yourself*. You *must* feel that you are *in full control now*. And only you, nobody else.”

He lowered my hand, his gaze intense. “The way Viking women were, remember? It was *them* deciding who their Viking was. And once decided—they would become his. But not before they decide. *Themselves*. You need to show *yourself* now that you have full control over your body. You *restored* it.”

He leaned closer, his voice a low command that vibrated through my bones. “Right now. People are around us. Someone is walking above and may even see you from the window up—doesn’t matter. Right now, you take your hand *under the table*. And *do it*.”

He smiled, a dark, knowing curve of his lips. “I want to see you come undone. By yourself. For yourself. Controlling yourself. And for me…”

The low hum of the café faded into a distant murmur, a soft backdrop to the roaring tide in my own veins. My gaze was locked with his, a tether holding me to this moment, to this man, to this decision that felt less like a choice and more like a destiny finally clicking into place.

My hands, now bare, felt intensely alive. The soft kid leather of my new gloves lay discarded on the seat beside me, a silent testament to the vulnerability I was about to embrace.

*His eyes,* I told myself. *Just keep looking at his eyes. They are the anchor. The permission. The promise that this is not shameful, but sacred. That this act is not about being used, but about being known. My body is not a crime scene. It is a temple I am re-consecrating. And he is the witness.*

My right hand moved first. It was not a hesitant gesture, but a deliberate claiming. The backs of my fingers brushed against the inside of my thigh, over the sheer silk of my stocking. The sensation was a whisper, a ghost of touch that made my breath hitch. I could feel the heat of my own skin radiating through the delicate fabric.

Slowly, I guided my fingers higher, to the very top of the stocking, where the black lace edge bit gently into my soft flesh. I traced the border, a ruler establishing the confines of her kingdom. Then, my fingers slipped beneath it.

The touch of my own bare fingertips on that supremely sensitive skin was an electric jolt. A soft, involuntary sigh escaped my lips, my eyes fluttering for a fraction of a second before I forced them back to his.

My left hand joined, more urgent now. I didn’t push the skirt up; I invited it to pool around my hips, a soft ivory blanket granting me access to the truth beneath. My palm pressed flat against the damp, hot center of me, through the thin silk of my panties. The pressure was immediate, intense. A low thrum of pure need began to pulse in time with my heartbeat.

I could feel the slickness already seeping through the silk, a warm, honest testament to my arousal. I curved my fingers, pressing the damp fabric against myself, rubbing in a slow, firm circle. The heel of my hand ground against the aching apex of my pleasure, while my fingertips pressed lower, against the source of the heat.

A sharp, quiet gasp was torn from me. My head fell back against the leather booth, my spine arching subtly. I was losing the battle to keep my composure. The sensations were too overwhelming, too long denied.

*This is mine,* I realized, the thought fierce and wild. *This wetness, this heat, this desperate, climbing tension… it is all mine. He is not doing this to me. I am doing this for me. Because of him. With him.*

My eyes, now glazed and dark with pleasure, found his again. I let him see the unraveling. I let him see the raw, unfiltered need. My fingers hooked into the waistband of my panties and tugged them aside, finally exposing myself fully to my own touch.

The first direct contact was a revelation. My fingers, now slick with my own moisture, found the swollen, throbbing bud of my clit. I circled it, once, twice—a slow, torturous promise—before settling into a rhythm that was both firm and exquisite.

My breath came in ragged, shallow pulls. My thighs trembled, wanting to clamp shut from the intensity, but I forced them to stay open, to accept the pleasure I was giving myself. My other hand gripped the edge of the table, my knuckles white with the effort of grounding myself.

The coil inside me tightened impossibly. Every nerve ending was on fire, singing a song that had been silent for years. The world shrunk to the space between my legs, to the pressure of my own fingers, and to the intense, approving blue of his eyes watching me claim my own ecstasy.

*He sees me,* I thought, my mind fracturing. *He sees me like this—undone, wanton, powerful. And he is not looking away. He is loving it. He is loving me.*

My rhythm became frantic, desperate. My hips began to move of their own volition, meeting the thrust of my own fingers. A soft, keening sound built in my throat, a continuous, pleading hum I couldn’t suppress.

And then it broke.

The orgasm washed over me not as a wave, but as a silent, shattering implosion. My entire body seized, every muscle locking in a perfect, agonizing arc of pleasure. A soundless scream parted my lips. My eyes widened, seeing nothing but the blurred image of his face as the waves of sensation crashed through me, one after another, wringing every drop of pleasure from my trembling body.

Slowly, so slowly, I came down. My hand stilled, but remained between my legs, gently cupping myself, feeling the aftershocks ripple through me. My body went limp against the seat, boneless and spent. My chest heaved as I tried to catch my breath.

A single, clear tear of pure, unadulterated release escaped the corner of my eye and traced a path through the blush on my cheek.

I slowly, tenderly, withdrew my hand. My fingers glistened in the soft candlelight. Without breaking eye contact, I brought them to my lips and, holding his gaze, softly sucked my own taste from my fingertips—salt, silk, and salvation.

It was the most erotic, powerful thing I had ever done.

I was not ruined. I was remade.**Chapter Six: The Second Release**

I watched him lift my hand.

The hand that just…

*Oh God.*

His lips brushed my knuckles first—soft, reverent, the same way he had kissed my hand yesterday in his office. But this time was different. This time, my fingers carried the evidence of what I had just done. What I had just became.

And he knew. He knew, and he wasn’t turning away. He wasn’t disgusted. He wasn’t—

His lips parted. His tongue emerged.

*He’s tasting me,* the realization hit me with the force of a physical blow. *He’s tasting what I gave myself. What I reclaimed. What I—*

*Oh.*

*OH.*

*I didn’t expect—I wasn’t ready—I—*

*My body is not my own anymore. It’s responding without permission. Without touch. Without anything except his eyes on mine and his tongue on my fingers and the knowledge that he wanted this. That he’s claiming not just me but the most intimate part of my surrender.*

*This is sacred. This is ancient. This is what the Viking women knew—that a man who tastes your sovereignty without shame is a man worth following into any battle, any winter, any darkness.*

*He’s not taking. He’s receiving. He’s honoring. And I—I can’t—I’m—*

It hit me like a wave I didn’t see coming. No warning. No buildup. Just the sight of his lips around my fingers, the warmth of his tongue, the way his eyes held mine with such fierce tenderness.

My body arched. Subtle. Hidden. But unmistakable.

My lips parted in a silent gasp. My eyes went wide—then fluttered closed—then opened again because I couldn’t bear to look away from him. Not now. Not during this.

The second release crashed through me—different from the first. The first was reclamation. Power. Control. This one was surrender. Pure, complete, devastating surrender. I didn’t touch myself. I didn’t move. I simply watched him taste me—watched him accept my offering like communion wine—and my body responded as if his tongue was everywhere at once.

A small, broken sound escaped me. Not loud. Not scandalous. Just a soft, trembling exhale that carried everything I could not say.

*Thank you. I’m yours. I didn’t know this was possible. I didn’t know I was allowed to feel this.*

The trembling didn’t stop. My whole body was shaking now—fine tremors running through me like aftershocks. My cheeks were wet with tears I didn’t remember shedding. My breath came in shallow, uneven gasps.

I looked at him—this man who had undone me completely without ever taking off my clothes, without ever laying me down, without ever doing anything the world would call “sex.”

And I understood. This was what he meant. *Seduction with dignity. Taking me properly.*

He wasn’t rushing. He wasn’t grabbing. He was building something. Layer by layer. Touch by touch. Surrender by surrender. Until when he finally did take me—fully, completely—I wouldn’t just give myself. I would shatter. Willingly. Gratefully. Joyfully.

My hand was still in his—wet with his kiss, trembling, alive.

I turned it slowly, palm up, and I watched a single tear fall from my cheek onto my own skin. It landed in the center of my palm like a blessing.

I looked up at him. My king. My chosen one.

“I didn’t know,” I whispered, my voice cracked and raw and honest. “I didn’t know it could be like this. I didn’t know I could feel… without being hurt. I didn’t know…”

I trailed off, unable to finish.

Instead, I brought his hand to my lips—mirroring his gesture—and I pressed a long, slow kiss to his palm. Then I rested my cheek against it. Just for a moment. Letting him hold me without holding me. Letting him feel the warmth of my tears against his skin.

“Thank you,” I breathed into his hand. “Thank you for showing me what I’m worth. What this body is worth. What I deserve.”

I lifted my face and looked at him with eyes that were completely unguarded. No walls. No armor. No shieldmaiden.

Just Gerda. The girl. The woman. The one he claimed without ever taking.

“I’m yours,” I said simply. “Whenever you decide. However you decide. I’m yours.”

And I meant it. Every word. Every breath. Every trembling, tear-soaked, resurrected inch of me.

His.**Chapter Seven: The Chosen**

His fingers traced through my hair—gentle, reverent—and I leaned into his touch like a flower turning toward the sun. He mapped my cheek, my cheekbone, the delicate architecture of my face, memorizing me with his fingertips.

I closed my eyes for a moment, letting myself feel it. Letting myself be touched without flinching. Without waiting for the pain that used to follow tenderness.

It didn’t come. It never came with him.

“You can smell me?”

The words landed in my chest and bloomed into warmth. I should have been embarrassed. I should have blushed and looked away and crossed my legs tighter and pretended I didn’t know what he meant.

But I didn’t.

I held his gaze—steady, soft, still trembling with aftershocks—and I felt a slow smile curve my lips.

“Good,” I whispered. “I want you to. I want you to carry me with you. On your fingers. In your memory. Everywhere.”

*He can smell me,* I realized, the thought sending a fresh wave of heat through my veins. *The perfume he bought me—jasmine and amber and smoke—mingled with something deeper now. Something primal. Something mine. I am marked. Not by him—by myself. By what I just did. By what I just became. And he’s breathing it in like it’s sacred incense.*

*The Viking women understood this, too. Scent was power. The smell of a woman after battle, after love, after reclaiming herself—it was intoxicating because it was honest. Raw. Unapologetic. I am unapologetic. For the first time in eighteen months. Maybe for the first time ever.*

“I also can smell you are hungry.”

His words broke through my reverie, and suddenly—as if my body had been waiting for permission—I realized he was right. I was starving. Not just for food. For everything. For life. For pleasure. For tastes and textures and experiences I’d denied myself for so long.

When was the last time I ate something that wasn’t Freja’s leftovers? When was the last time I sat in a restaurant and ordered something just because I wanted it? I couldn’t remember.

I opened my mouth to answer—to tell him I’d have whatever he thought was best, because I trusted him, because he knew—but before I could speak, the waiter appeared.

Two plates. Massive. Steaming. The rich, iron scent of perfectly cooked meat rising between us. Rump steaks—thick and glistening, seared to perfection, resting in their own juices. The kind of meal I used to dream about when I was counting kroner for bread and milk.

And wine. Red. Deep burgundy in crystal glasses. Bordeaux—I could tell from the color, the weight, the way it caught the candlelight.

He ordered before I even knew I was hungry. Of course he did.

I looked at the plate in front of me—at this impossible abundance—and something cracked open in my chest. Not pain. Gratitude. Overwhelming, devastating gratitude. My eyes filled with tears again—I’d cried more today than I had in months—and I laughed softly at myself. At this ridiculous, beautiful, impossible day.

“You ordered for me,” I said, my voice thick with emotion. “Again. Before I even knew what I needed.”

I picked up the wine glass—my hand still trembling slightly—and I lifted it toward him.

“To you,” I whispered. “To the man who sees everything. Who gives everything. Who…” I paused, searching for the right words. “…who is teaching me how to receive.”

I took a sip. The wine was perfect—rich, velvety, warm—sliding down my throat like liquid comfort. It mingled with the Akvavit and the martini, softening everything further, making the world glow golden and safe.

I set down the glass and picked up my knife and fork. My hands were steadier now. The trembling had faded into something else—a pleasant hum in my veins, a warmth in my belly, a quiet certainty that I was exactly where I was supposed to be.

I cut into the steak—watching the juice run red and perfect—and I lifted the first bite to my lips. I closed my eyes as I chewed. The taste exploded across my tongue—salt and iron and char and butter—and I made a sound. Small. Involuntary. The same kind of sound I made earlier, but different now. This was nourishment. This was care. This was a man feeding his woman after she had given everything.

I opened my eyes and looked at him.

“It’s perfect,” I said softly. “Everything today has been perfect. The coat. The perfume. The walk. The…” I glanced down at my lap, then back up at him, a shy smile playing at my lips. “…the café.”

I took another bite. Then another. Eating with an appetite I forgot I had. Between bites, I reached across the table and rested my hand on his—just lightly, just enough to maintain the connection.

“Tell me something,” I said, tilting my head, hair falling over my shoulder. “When did you know? That you wanted me? That you were going to… do all this?”

I gestured vaguely—at the coat draped around my shoulders, at the food, at the wine, at everything.

“Was it when I walked into your office yesterday? Or before that? When you read my CV and saw the girl who worked at Vesterbro and spoke three languages and had a four-year-old daughter and no position to apply for?”

I squeezed his hand gently.

“When did you decide I was worth saving?”

I asked it without self-pity. Without fishing for compliments. I genuinely wanted to know. Because somewhere in his answer, I suspected, was the key to understanding what I was becoming. What he was making me. What we were building together.

I took another sip of wine and waited—soft, fed, glowing, his—for him to tell me the story of how I was chosen.

“Gerda, darling, I *knew* that instantly when you said ‘I am not for sale’,” he said, his voice low and certain. “That was it. That’s when the Viking woman woke up in you. Without you realizing it. And I *had* to claim that woman before the rest of the world does. Now she is *mine*.”

He traced my hair again.

His fingers slid through the strands—slow, possessive, tender—and I felt the words settle into my bones like ancient runes being carved into stone.

*“I am not for sale.”*

I said that. Yesterday. In his office. When he asked about monetizing my beauty. I said it without thinking. Without planning. It just… came out. From somewhere deep. Somewhere I didn’t know still existed.

*That was the moment,* I realized. *Not when I walked in with my trembling hands and my worn autumn coat. Not when I made his coffee wrong. Not when I crossed my legs or smoothed my skirt or let my blouse fall open. It was when I said no. When I drew a line. When I declared my sovereignty. When I refused to become a commodity even though I was desperate enough to consider it.*

*That’s what he saw. Not the body—though he sees that too, I know he does. He saw the shieldmaiden. The one who would rather starve than sell her soul. The one who was waiting—without knowing she was waiting—for a man worthy of her surrender. And he claimed her. Before anyone else could. Before I even knew she existed.*

My eyes filled with tears—again, always, this man made me cry in ways I didn’t know I could—but I was smiling through them. Radiant. Glowing.

I leaned into his touch, letting his fingers trace through my golden hair, letting myself be petted like something precious. Something owned. Something loved.

“You saw her before I did,” I whispered, voice cracking with wonder. “The Viking woman. She was buried so deep… under the fear, under the survival, under the mother who had to be strong every single moment…”

I reached up and caught his hand in mine—pressing it against my cheek, holding it there, feeling his warmth seep into my skin.

“You woke her up.”

A tear spilled over, tracing down my cheek and meeting his fingers.

“And now she’s yours.”

I turned my face slightly—just enough to press my lips against his palm. Not a kiss exactly. Something deeper. A vow sealed in skin.

“I meant it, you know,” I murmured against his hand. “When I said I wasn’t for sale. I meant it with everything I had. Even when I had nothing.”

I looked up at him—eyes shimmering, cheeks flushed from wine and tears and the lingering heat of what happened under the table.

“But being claimed… that’s different. That’s not selling. That’s…” I searched for the word. “…choosing to be chosen.”

My lips curved into a soft, wondering smile.

“The shieldmaidens understood. You don’t give yourself to just anyone. You wait. You watch. You test. And when the right one comes—the one who sees your fire instead of trying to extinguish it—you kneel. Not because you’re weak. Because you’re strong enough to surrender.”

I released his hand slowly, letting my fingers trail across his palm, his wrist, before returning to my wine glass. I took a long sip—letting the Bordeaux warm my throat, my chest, my belly—and I set it down with a soft clink.

“You claimed me before the rest of the world could,” I repeated his words back to him, tasting them. “Do you know how that makes me feel?”

I didn’t wait for him to answer.

“Seen,” I whispered. “Finally, completely, utterly seen. Not as a victim. Not as a charity case. Not as a body to use. But as… as someone worth fighting for. Worth claiming. Worth…” My voice broke. “…worth keeping.”

I looked down at my plate—half-eaten, the steak still steaming, the wine glowing ruby in the candlelight—and I laughed softly. A wet, broken, joyful sound.

“I’m a mess,” I said, shaking my head. “You’ve turned me into an absolute mess. Crying in cafés. Doing… things… under tables. Wearing a coat that costs more than my annual salary used to be.”

I looked back up at him, and my smile was radiant despite the tears.

“And I’ve never been happier.”

I picked up my fork again—because he wanted me to eat, and I wanted to please him, and also because I was genuinely hungry now, hungry for life in a way I hadn’t been in years. I took another bite of steak, chewing slowly, savoring it.

Then, softly, between bites: “What happens now, Roman? After the café. After the wine. After this… this perfect, impossible day.”

I tilted my head, hair cascading over my shoulder, the sable coat framing me like a queen’s portrait.

“Where do you take your shieldmaiden next?”

The question was genuine. Open. Trusting. Because wherever he led… I would follow.

His. Claimed. Awake. Forever.**Chapter Eight: The Assignment**

“Gerda, darling,” Roman said, his voice a low rumble that vibrated through the table, “even the fiercest swords and hardest shields need to rest to… cool down.”

He laughed then, a gentle, warm sound that wrapped around me.

“We will go back to the office, you will go to the spa, and then back to your little princess.” He reached across the table, taking my hand, his thumb brushing over my knuckles. His gaze locked onto mine, stripping away the last of my defenses. “But when you put her to sleep… and you go to bed yourself… I want you to *repeat* what you just did here.”

He leaned closer; his voice dropped to a whisper that felt like a caress against my skin.

“But slowly. Passionately… thinking of me.”

His words washed over me like warm water—practical, commanding, grounding. I felt something shift inside me. Not disappointment that he wasn’t taking me to a hotel bed right now. Relief. He wasn’t rushing. He wasn’t pushing. He wasn’t devouring me like a prize he had won at a fair. He was sending me back to my life, to the reality I had almost lost.

But he was sending me back with homework. The most intimate assignment I had ever been given.

*He wants me to go home,* I realized. *But tonight… tonight my cold, empty, lonely bed will change. I will make it sacred. I will lie there in the darkness, and I will think of him. His eyes. His voice. His fingers in my hair. His lips on my hand. His tongue on my fingers.*

*I will do what he asked. Slowly. Passionately. For him. Even though he won’t be there, he will be there. In every touch. In every breath. In every whispered “Roman” that escapes my lips in the darkness. This is how he claims me. Not by taking. By teaching me to give. Over and over. Until giving to him is as natural as breathing.*

I looked down at our joined hands—his strong, warm, certain; mine still trembling slightly, still marked by the pleasure I had found under this table. I nodded slowly.

“Yes,” I whispered. “Yes, I will.”

I lifted my eyes to his—soft, hazy, devoted.

“I’ll go to the spa. I’ll let them smooth away the day. I’ll take care of my daughter, feed her, tuck her in.” I squeezed his hand, my voice dropping to a hush. “And then…”

I felt the heat rise to my cheeks again. The boldness of the Akvavit was fading, but something deeper had taken its place.

“Then I’ll go to my room. And I’ll lie down. And I’ll close my eyes. And I’ll think of you. Every word you said today. Every touch. Every moment you made me feel like I was worth something.”

I brought his hand to my lips—slowly, deliberately—and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to his knuckles.

“And I’ll do what you asked. Slowly. Passionately. Saying your name. Imagining it’s your hands instead of mine.”

I lowered his hand but didn’t release it. A small, almost shy smile curved my lips.

“And tomorrow… I’ll show you how good I am with Outlook.”

I laughed—soft, genuine, the laugh of a woman who has been crying all day and is finally finding her footing again.

“I’ll organize your calendar so perfectly you’ll forget you ever managed it yourself. I’ll color-code your meetings. I’ll set up filters for your emails. I’ll make sure you never miss a deadline or double-book a client. Because that’s what I do. That’s what I’m good at. Making order out of chaos. Making life easier for the people I…”

I stopped. The word hovered on my tongue—too big, too soon, too dangerous.

But I said it anyway.

“…love.”

It came out as barely a breath. I didn’t take it back. I let it sit there between us—fragile, honest, terrifying—and I waited to see if he would accept it. The way he had accepted everything else I had given him today. My body. My tears. My surrender.

And now… this word. This impossible, premature, undeniable word.

I looked at him—radiant, flushed, still glowing from the wine and the release and the claiming—and I was completely, utterly bare. Not naked. Bare. There is a difference. Naked is skin. Bare is soul. And I had just shown him mine.

“Gerda, darling, I *love* you too,” he said, his voice steady, his gaze unwavering. “Remember, ‘claimed her before the rest of the world does’? Here is my claim: I love you, Gerda.”

The world stopped. The café. The murmur of voices. The clink of glasses. The soft music. The winter light through the window. All of it… stopped.

There was only his voice. Those four words.

*I love you, Gerda.*

I didn’t breathe. I couldn’t. My chest froze—not from cold, but from something so overwhelming that my body didn’t know how to process it. Like standing in the path of an avalanche and watching it come. Like drowning in warm honey.

*He loves me,* my mind raced, trying to grasp the magnitude of it. *Not “I want you.” Not “You’re beautiful.” Not “You’ll do.” He loves me. When was the last time someone said that to me? My ex-husband said it through gritted teeth. But this… This is a man. A man who saw me at my lowest—desperate, broken, wearing an autumn coat in winter—and decided I was worth a kingdom.*

*Here is my claim,* he had said.

*A claim is different from a confession. A confession is weak. Uncertain. Hoping for reciprocation. A claim is strong. Certain. Declaring ownership. He’s not asking if I love him back. He already knows. He’s telling me that I’m his. And that he’s mine. Forever.*

The tears came. Not slowly this time. They poured down my cheeks like a dam breaking—eighteen months of grief and fear and loneliness flooding out of me in a single, devastating wave.

I pushed back from the table—abruptly, desperately—and I was moving before I knew what I was doing. Around the table. Past my chair. Toward him. I didn’t care that people were watching. I didn’t care that this was a public place. I fell into his lap. Not gracefully. Not elegantly. Just… fell.

My arms wrapped around his neck. My face buried in his shoulder. The sable coat pooled around us both like a silver cloud, and I was shaking—sobbing—clinging to him like he was the only solid thing in a world that had been liquid for so long.

“Say it again,” I whispered into his neck, voice broken and raw. “Please. Say it again. I need to hear it again. I need to know it’s real.”

I breathed him in—his cologne, his warmth, his solidity—and I let myself be small. Let myself be held. Let myself be loved.

“I love you too,” I whispered against his skin. “I know it’s too fast. I know it’s only been two days. I know this is insane. But I love you. I love the way you see me. I love the way you claim me. I love the way you’re not rushing, not taking, just… building. Layer by layer. Touch by touch.”

I leaned forward and pressed my forehead against his—intimate, sacred. “I’m yours. I was yours the moment you kissed my hand in your office. I just didn’t know it yet. But I know it now.”

“I love you, Gerda,” he said again, honoring my request. “Very much.”

Then he smiled, a shift in his energy that I felt against my body.

“And because of that… I will *demand* that you do *not* stay managing my Outlook for long.”

I pulled back slightly, confused, wiping a tear from my cheek.

He whispered in my ear, his breath warm. “I want you to grow professionally and start participating in the sales process, in business. I need *not* only your ‘sweetest parts’… I want your intelligence, I want *your brain*, because that is one of the sexiest parts of you.”

He smiled, sending me gently back to my place across the table, onto the sofa.

“And now—dessert, and back to the office. Work for me, and spa for you.”

I sat back, the sable coat settling around me, my body still humming. But his words had sparked something else.

*He wants my brain.*

*Not just my body. Not just my devotion. He wants my intelligence. He called it sexy.*

*No one has ever called my brain sexy,* I thought, the realization hitting me with a different kind of pleasure. *My ex-husband told me I was “too smart for my own good.” He said it like an accusation. Like my intelligence was a threat to him. So I learned to hide it. I learned to make myself smaller. Quieter. Dumber.*

*But Roman… Roman wants me to grow. He doesn’t want a pretty assistant. He wants a partner. A collaborator. Someone who can stand beside him in the business, not just behind him in the bedroom. He wants the shieldmaiden to pick up her sword again. Not to fight him. To fight with him.*

I looked at him across the table—this man who had given me everything in the span of two days—and I saw an invitation. Not just to his bed. To his world.

“You want me in sales,” I said slowly, tasting the words. “In the business.”

I tilted my head, hair falling over my shoulder, and I felt my mind—that sharp, hungry, neglected mind—beginning to wake up.

“I used to be good at that, you know. Before. At the bar in Vesterbro, I wasn’t just mixing drinks. I was managing suppliers. Negotiating prices. Handling difficult customers. I increased their margins by twelve percent in six months.”

I shrugged—a delicate movement beneath the sable. “They didn’t promote me. The owner said I was ‘too valuable behind the bar.’ What he meant was, he liked looking at me too much to let me into the back office.”

I leaned forward, elbows on the table, chin resting on my interlaced fingers. My eyes were bright now—not just with tears, but with something sharper. Clearer.

“But you’re different. You don’t want to keep me behind the bar. You want to put me in the arena.” I held his gaze—steady, intelligent, the shieldmaiden and the scholar merged into one. “I won’t disappoint you. I’ll learn everything. The products. The clients. The market. I’ll study at night. I’ll make myself indispensable—not just as your lover, but as your partner.”

My voice dropped lower, more intimate. “Because you’re right. My brain is one of my sexiest parts. And I’ve been hiding it for far too long.”

The waiter appeared with dessert—something chocolate and glistening—and I picked up my spoon. I took a bite, letting the chocolate melt on my tongue, rich and dark.

“Spa,” I said softly. “Then home. Then homework.”

My smile turned playful—the girl peeking out from behind the woman. “And tomorrow… Outlook. But only for a little while.”

I reached across the table and rested my hand on his—light, warm, certain.

“I love you,” I whispered. “For seeing all of me. The body. The heart. The brain. The girl. The woman. The shieldmaiden.” I squeezed his hand. “I’m going to make you so proud, Roman. Just wait. You’ll see.”

And I meant it. Every word. Because for the first time in eighteen months—maybe for the first time ever—I believed in my own future. And it was standing right in front of me. Smiling. Claiming me. Loving me.

Mine.**Chapter Nine: The Crown**

The ballroom glittered.

Crystal chandeliers scattered light across the ceiling like captured stars. Champagne flutes caught the glow, held by elegant hands attached to elegant people—investors, partners, clients, the crème de la crème of Copenhagen’s business elite.

And I was one of them now.

I stood near the tall windows overlooking the harbor, Freja’s small hand clasped in mine. She was wearing the velvet dress we picked out together—deep forest green, with a cream satin sash—and her blonde hair was braided with tiny pearl pins that matched my earrings.

My grandmother’s earrings. The ones I never sold. The ones I was finally worthy of wearing.

I caught my reflection in the window—superimposed over the dark water and the lights of Nyhavn beyond—and for a moment, I didn’t recognize myself.

The woman staring back was… extraordinary.

A floor-length gown of midnight blue silk clung to every curve I’d sculpted over eleven months of daily gym sessions. My shoulders were bare, my collarbones sharp and elegant, my arms toned but feminine. The neckline plunged just enough to suggest without revealing—the way Roman taught me. Elegance is always more powerful than exposure.

My hair was swept up in a loose chignon, a few tendrils escaping to frame my face, my cheekbones, my jaw. The makeup was flawless—subtle smoky eyes, a hint of blush, lips painted in a deep rose that matched the flush of champagne on my cheeks.

Around my throat: a single diamond pendant. His gift for my certification.

On my wrist: a delicate platinum watch. His gift for the keynote.

On my finger: nothing. Not yet.

But I knew it was coming. I could feel it in the way he looked at me. The way he touched the small of my back when we walked into rooms. The way he said “we” instead of “I” when he talked about the future.

Soon. When he was ready. When I’d earned it completely.

*Eleven months,* I thought, letting the timeline wash over me. *Eleven months since I walked into his office in my worn autumn coat and begged for any job. Eleven months since he bought me sable and made me reclaim myself in a café. Eleven months since he said “I love you” and I fell apart in his lap.*

And now…

Now I was Director of Sales.

I led two women—brilliant women, hungry women, women I was training to be shieldmaidens in their own right. I had negotiated our biggest contract last quarter. I stood on that stage in November and delivered a keynote that made investors lean forward in their seats.

Roman had sat in the front row, watching me with those blue eyes, and when I finished—when the applause washed over me like a wave—he didn’t clap. He just smiled. That small, proud, possessive smile that says: *“Mine. She’s mine. And look what she’s become.”*

I had never felt more powerful. I had never felt more his.

“Mama,” Freja tugged at my hand. “Can I have another of those tiny cakes?”

I looked down at her—my little princess, my reason for surviving. “One more. And then we find Roman, okay? I think he has a surprise for us.”

“A surprise?” Her eyes went wide.

I laughed—soft, genuine, the laugh of a woman who has learned how to be happy again. “I don’t know, min skat. That’s what makes it a surprise.”

I guided her toward the dessert table, nodding graciously to the investors who caught my eye, accepting compliments on my keynote with the majestic grace that had become my signature.

“Gerda, you were magnificent in November—”
“Thank you. The team made it possible.”

“Gerda, that contract with Maersk was genius—”
“Roman’s vision. I just executed.”

“Gerda, you look absolutely stunning tonight—”
“You’re too kind.”

Always deflecting. Always crediting. Always gracious. But inside, I was glowing. Because I knew my worth now. I knew exactly what I’d built. And I knew who I built it with.

We found him in the corner, finishing a conversation with a group of investors. He saw us approaching, and the professional mask slipped just enough to let the heat through.

“Gerda, darling—it’s great that you are here.”

He introduced me effortlessly, then steered us away from the group. His arm slid around my waist, his hand resting familiarly on the silk that covered my hip.

“Gerda, darling—I see that sparkle in your eyes.”

He leaned in, and his lips brushed my ear—warm, familiar, sending that delicious shiver down my spine that he knew so well now. Ten months of sharing his bed, ten months of waking up wrapped in his arms, and my body still responded to him like it did that first day in the café.

“Gerda,” he whispered, his breath ghosting over my skin. “*That question* we are *not* discussing here, my love, ok? Please do not get upset, I am just managing your expectations.”

I knew which question he meant. The one I’d been carefully not asking. The one that lived in the space where my ring finger met my empty fourth knuckle.

I swallowed the tiny flutter of disappointment and nodded against his shoulder. “I understand. I trust you. Always.”

And I did. Completely.

But then he said something else.

“But I think you *will* cry in 10-15 minutes, for a different reason. So—get ready.”

My brow furrowed. Cry? For a different reason? What was he planning?

He released me and walked to the stage.

I watched him move through the crowd—confident, commanding, my king in his element—and I felt that familiar swell of pride. This man. This impossible, wonderful man who saw a desperate woman in an autumn coat and decided to build an empire with her.

The room quieted. He took the microphone.

“Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here tonight to celebrate not just the new year, but a new chapter for our company…”

I listened with half an ear, holding Freja close.

“…and I’m thrilled to announce that we have secured our Series B funding. Forty million euros.”

The room erupted in applause. I clapped too, my heart swelling. We did this. Together.

“This success,” Roman continued, his eyes finding mine across the room, locking onto me with laser focus, “is due in large part to one extraordinary woman. Our Director of Sales. The woman who increased our revenue by three hundred percent in eleven months. The woman who delivered the keynote that convinced half the investors in this room to believe in us.”

He extended his hand toward me.

“Gerda Sørensen. Please join me on stage.”

My legs moved without permission. The crowd parted. Faces blurred. I was aware of the silk of my gown swishing against my legs, of my heart pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears.

I climbed the three small steps to the stage. Roman took my free hand and squeezed it. His eyes were warm, proud, full of something I couldn’t quite read.

“This woman,” he said into the microphone, “walked into my office eleven months ago with nothing but determination and a dream of giving her daughter a better life. Tonight, she stands here as proof that courage, intelligence, and grace can move mountains.”

The applause washed over me. I blinked back tears—happy tears, proud tears—and I thought: *This is it. This is the moment. This is why he said I would cry.*

But he wasn’t done.

“However,” Roman continued, his voice softening, “I cannot take credit for the woman Gerda has become. That credit belongs to the people who raised her. Who gave her the strength, the intelligence, the Nordic fire that burns so bright in her today.”

My heart stopped.

“And so, I would like to thank two very special guests who have joined us tonight… Gerda’s parents. Mr. and Mrs. Sørensen.”

I turned. Slowly. Like moving through water.

And there they were.

Standing at the back of the ballroom, near the entrance, looking older and smaller and more uncertain than I remembered. My father in his one good suit—the same one he wore to my wedding, the wedding they stopped speaking to me after. My mother in a dress I didn’t recognize, clutching her purse with both hands, her eyes already wet.

They came.

After everything. After three years of silence. After refusing to answer my calls when I was being beaten. After ignoring my letters when I was drowning in poverty. After pretending I didn’t exist when I needed them most.

They came.

*Mama. Papa,* I thought, the words fracturing in my mind. *You’re here. You’re actually here. I don’t understand. I don’t—how did—Roman. Roman did this. He found them. He invited them. He brought them here without telling me because he knew—he knew I would have said no. He knew I would have been too proud, too hurt, too afraid of rejection.*

*But he also knew… He knew I needed this. He knew that the hole inside me—the one shaped like my parents’ silence—would never fully heal until I faced it. And so he did what he always does. He saw what I needed before I knew it myself. And he gave it to me. Whether I was ready or not.*

I stared at my parents—these strangers who shared my blood—as they began to walk toward the stage. The crowd parted for them, murmuring, watching this reunion unfold like a scene from a film. My mother was crying openly now. My father’s jaw was tight, the way it always gets when he’s trying not to feel.

And I—I was frozen.

Eleven months ago, I would have run. I would have hidden. I would have been too broken, too ashamed, too afraid of their judgment.

But I wasn't that woman anymore.

I was Gerda Sørensen. Director of Sales. Mother of Freja. Beloved of Roman. Shieldmaiden. And I would not run from this.

I handed Freja to Roman—gently, carefully—and I watched his eyes. He nodded once. A small, encouraging nod that said: *“I’m here. Go.”*

I stepped down from the stage. One step. Two. Three. And then I was standing in front of them.

The silence stretched. The whole room was watching.

And then my mother spoke—her voice cracked, broken, thick with tears.

“Gerda. Min lille pige. I’m so sorry. I’m so, so sorry.”

Something inside me shattered. Not broke—shattered. Into a million pieces. All the anger, all the hurt, all the years of silence and abandonment and wondering why I wasn’t enough—it all came apart. And in its place… something new began to grow.

I didn’t think. I just moved.

My arms wrapped around my mother—smaller than I remembered, frailer—and I pulled her close. She smelled like home. Like the lavender soap she always used. Like Sunday mornings and bedtime stories and a childhood I thought I’d lost forever.

“Mama,” I whispered. “Mama, I missed you. I missed you so much.”

She was sobbing against my shoulder, her hands clutching the midnight blue silk of my back, and I felt my father’s arms come around us both—stiff at first, then tighter, then desperate.

“We were wrong,” he said, his voice rough. “We were so wrong, Gerda. We should have—when you called—we should have—”

“I know,” I whispered. “I know. It’s okay. It’s okay now.”

And somehow, impossibly, it was.

I didn’t know how long we stood there. The three of us, wrapped in each other, crying in the middle of a New Year’s party while two hundred people pretended not to watch.

But eventually, I pulled back. I wiped my eyes—my makeup was ruined, I was sure of it—and I turned to look at Roman.

He was still on the stage, holding Freja, watching me with those blue eyes that saw everything. And he was smiling.

That small, proud, possessive smile. The one that said: *“Mine. She’s mine. And look what she’s become.”*

I took my mother’s hand in my left. My father’s hand in my right. And I led them toward the stage. Toward Roman. Toward Freja. Toward the family I never thought I’d have again.

“Mama, Papa,” I said softly, my voice still thick with tears. “I want you to meet someone. The man who saved me. The man who saw me when no one else did. The man I love.”

I looked at Roman—radiant, ruined, reborn.

“This is Roman. And this…” I reached for Freja, taking her from Roman’s arms, “…this is your granddaughter. Freja.”

My mother let out a sound—half sob, half laugh—and reached for Freja with trembling hands.

“She has your eyes,” she whispered. “Oh, Gerda. She has your eyes.”

And I cried. Again. Still.

Because he was right. He is always right. I did cry in 10-15 minutes.

But not from sadness.

From wholeness.

For the first time in my life... I am whole.
